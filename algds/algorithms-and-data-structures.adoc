My notes accumulated over time regarding algorithms and data structures.

== Data Structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationship between those values, and operations that can be applied to the data (values of the collections).

An array, for example, contains values, each on its own index.
Arrays are sorted, so, that is one type of relation between the values of the array.
One can append or remove a value from the array, or reverse the values, which are examples of operations.

Different data structures are good for different, particular problems, and their time complexity varies.

Need sorted stuff? Use an array.

Need stem:[O(1)] time access to each one element?
Use an array or an object/hash table?

Need performant way to add an element somewhere in the “middle” of a data structure?
Use a linked list.

Need fast ordered list with insert/removal from beginning and end?
Don't use an array (adding to the beginning is expensive).
Use a linked list.

Working with a map/location/GPS data?
Use a graph (find shortest paths between points in a graph.)

Web-scraping nested HTML?
Use a tree.

A scheduler (task priority)?
Use a binary heap.

Etc., etc...

Some data structures are more generic (like arrays or objects/hash maps), whilst some are more specialized.

In short, *different data structure excel in different aspects*.
There is no better or worse.
