== Intro

Write a program that takes a whole number and loops from 1 to that number.
Then apply these conditions (not necessary in the order described here):

* If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".
* If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz".
* If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
* Else print the number itself.

From 1 to 15, this would be the output:

.fizzbuzz 1 to 15 output
