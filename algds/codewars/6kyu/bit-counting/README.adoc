== Approach 1

To do this, we need to turn the number into its string binary representation.
Then we make it an array or list of sorts and filter and count the 1's.

=== JavaScript Number.prototype.toString() two's complement

Look:

----
> (3).toString(2)
"11"

> (-3 >>> 0).toString(2)
"11111111111111111111111111111101"

> (-3).toString(2)
"-11"
----

The last example is “wrong”.
It seems the JS engine simply converted the positive 3 to binary and then prepended the negative sign.
