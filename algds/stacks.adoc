== Intro

Stack is a concept.
Last in, first out (LIFO).

Can be implemented with array `push()` and `pop()`.

Yet, as we need only order but not indexes for stacks, we are probably better of by making use a a singly or doubly linked list.

== push()

T.C. stem:[O(1)].

* let `newNode` to be a new node.
* If the stack is empty:
** Set `first` and `last` to be the new node.
* If the stack is not empty:
** Save a reference `oldFirst` to the current `first`.
** Set the new node as `first`.
** Set `newNode.next` to `oldFirst`.
* Increment `size` by 1.
* Return `size`.
