== Singly Linked Lists vs Arrays

Singly linked lists are a good alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required (inserting at the end of an array is T.C. stem:[O(1)]), but at the beginning causes all the remaining elements to shift/re-index).

Arrays contain built-in index; linked lists do not.
