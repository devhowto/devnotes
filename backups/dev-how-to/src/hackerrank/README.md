# HackerRank Challenges

Looks like HackerRank ranks exercises by their difficulty using these words:

- easy
- medium
- hard
- advanced
- expert

Therefore, we can create a nice structure for developing the solutions with this command:

```shell-session
$ mkdir -pv src/hackerrank/typescript/{1-easy,2-medium,3-hard,4-advanced,5-expert}
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript'
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript/1-easy'
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript/2-medium'
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript/3-hard'
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript/4-advanced'
mkdir: created directory 'src/hackerrank/typescript/5-expert'
```
