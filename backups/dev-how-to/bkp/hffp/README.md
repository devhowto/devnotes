# Haskell From First Principles

My notes and solutions for the book [Haskell From First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/). Thanks [Chris](https://bitemyapp.com/) for giving me a PDF copy of the [book](https://haskellbook.com/) for free. Amazing! ❤️

The [original repo is on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/programming-studies/haskell-from-first-principles). The [Github repo](https://github.com/FernandoBasso/Haskell-From-First-Principles) is just a push repo that keeps up to date with what I push to Gitlab.
