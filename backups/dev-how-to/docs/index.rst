Dev How To

Intro
-----

This project is a compilation of my own work mixed with ideas and
notes I learn from others. You'll find pages with tutorial-like
explanations on things that interest me and code solutions for book
exercises, coding challenges, algorithms and data structures,
functional programming stuff, etc.

If you find any problems, or have suggestions, you are welcome to
create an issue or a pull request in the `Dev How To Gitlab repository`_.
