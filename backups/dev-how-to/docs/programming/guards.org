#+TITLE: Guards

My reply to [[https://dev.to/oaraujocesar/clean-code-guards-you-shall-not-pass-3c5p][César Araújo post about guards]].

Yeah, it is nice to combine guards with early
returns to avoid nesting logic inside ifs.

Your explanation is very good! I would like to add
two more very simple snippets of code that help one
to visualize how guards with early returns help
avoid unnecessary NESTING. The snippets bellow don't
bring anything new beyond what was already shown in
the post. They just show and emphasize some points
under a different perspective.

#+begin_src
function f(x) {
  if (x > 0) {
    // Logic NESTED inside if.
  }
}
#+end_src

We can do this:

#+begin_src
function f(x) {
  if (x < 0) return 'Oops...';

  //
  // Main logic NOT nested inside if.
  //
}
#+end_src

By using this second approach, we reduce the need to
write logic too deeply nested inside of ifs (or any
other control structures for that matter). Less
nesting is generally better :)
