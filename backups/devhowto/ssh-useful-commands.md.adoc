= Useful SSH Commands

!!!
info

 For the commands that follow, let's assume the local user running these
 commands is the user “yoda”.

== Generate private/public keys pair

By default, `ssh-keygen` generates files in `$PWD`.
It creates two files: "id_+++<key-type>+++" and "id_+++<key-type>+++.pub".
We can use `-f` to specify the output directory (it must be created separately because `ssh-keygen` does not create it automatically).
`ssh-keygen` will then create a private key (no extension) and a public key (with the extension "`.pub`").+++</key-type>++++++</key-type>+++

[,shell-session]
----
$ mkdir -pv "$HOME/.ssh"

$ ssh-keygen \
    -t rsa \
    -b 4096 \
    -C 'Master Yoda <yoda@master.io>' \
    -f ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/yoda/.ssh/id_master-yoda
Your public key has been saved in /home/yoda/.ssh/id_master-yoda.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:L6aNdKu9aUNf8KcuovXMO0MR9sYHJwKuEpCktvNRdwo yoda@master.io
The key's randomart image is:

....
Pass the directory **with** the desired filename as well: DO NOT pass only
the directory to `-f`.

```text
# WRONG:
-f ~/.ssh

# CORRECT:
-f ~/.ssh/id-my-key-file-name
```

== Copy Public SSH Key to Remote Host

In order to be able to login to a remote host using the private key, we must first copy it to the other machine (the password for the user's machine will be required at least for this once).

The next command line will append the contents of the local public key to `/home/your_ssh_user/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host:

[,shell-session]
----
$ ssh-copy-id \
    -i ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda.pub \
    someuser@somehost
----

Then try to login with the command below.
It should let you login without asking for the remote host's user password.
It should either ask for the private key's passphrase or ask for nothing at all if the passphrase was created without a password.

[,shell-session]
----
$ ssh \
    -i ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda
    someuser@somehost
----

Note that we provide which identity key file to use with the `-i` command line option to `ssh`.

== Creating a Config for a Host

Instead of typing a long command line (or relying on retrieving it from the shell's history), we could add a few lines to `~/.ssh/config` so we could log into the remote host with a short and quick command line.

Here's one example:

```text title="~/.ssh/config example" Host jediacademy   Hostname jediacademy.example.org   Port 22   User yoda   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda

----

From now on, the user could log into the remote host with this command:

```shell-session
$ ssh jediacademy
----

Even shell Tab-completion should work on most systems, depending on the shell used and its configuration (works by default with Bash on Arch Linux, for instance).

== Common Problems

It is not uncommon that we face problems and logins do not work.
Let's name a few here.

=== Wrong File Permissions

SSH is very sensitive to file permissions.
These are the ones on my machine:

[,shell-session]
----
$ stat -c '%A %a %n' ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda*
-rw-r--r-- 644 /home/yoda/.ssh/config
-rw------- 600 /home/yoda/.ssh/id_master-yoda
-rw-r--r-- 644 /home/yoda/.ssh/id_master-yoda.pub
----

!!!
info

....
Note that the private key is `rw` for my user. The man page says
it should be `r` only. We won't ever change the contents of the
private key. It probably got that extra `w` because in general,
by default, users have the right to write to files they have
created. We could change that if so inclined to do so:

```shell-session
$ chmod -v u-w ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda
mode of '/home/yoda/.ssh/id_master-yoda' changed
from 0600 (rw-------) to 0400 (r--------)
```
....

See `man ssh` and look for the https://man.archlinux.org/man/ssh.1#FILES[_FILES_] section for detailed and precise information.

=== Incompatible or Missing Host Key Type

You try to run a simple SSH command and get an error like this:

____
Unable to negotiate with _some host or IP_ port 22: no matching host key type found.
Their offer: ssh-rsa
____

This has to do with one side of the communication trying to use one algorithm while the other side does not recognize or accepts it due to the configuration.
In this case, the client -- not the server (sshd) -- is failing to specify `ssh-rsa` as the host key signature algorithms that the client wants to use.
So, what we do is to either provide the option on the command line or in the config file:

[,shell-session]
----
$ ssh-copy-id \
    -o 'HostKeyAlgorithms = +ssh-rsa' \
    -i ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda.pub \
    yoda@jediacademy.example.org
----

In the config file, it would look like this:

`text title="~/.ssh/config with extra options" Host jediacademy   Hostname jediacademy.example.org   Port 22   User yoda   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_master-yoda   HostKeyAlgorithms = +ssh-rsa `

!!!
note

 Beware of the `+` in front of `ssh-rsa`. It means *append* this
 algorithm rather than replace the existing ones.
