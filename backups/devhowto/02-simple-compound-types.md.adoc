= Simple Compound Types
:pp: {plus}{plus}

*INFO*: This topic starts at https://youtu.be/wD5WGkOEJRs?t=368[06:08 in the video].

Arrays and tuples can be used bracket syntax or generic syntax:

[,ts]
----
const xs: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
const ys: Array<number> = [4, 5, 6];
----

!!!
info

 Ted thinks kinda feels like they misnamed union and intersection
 types. He says that perhaps `&` should mean the union and `|`
 should mean the intersection.

== Union Types (EITHER/OR)

* Union types use a pipe `|` to denote "`OR`" (a sum type, not a product type).
* Similar to "`union`" types from C/C{pp} (done at the declaration;
not a new type).
* Anything assignable to one of the union's members is accepted.
* Any property from any of the union's members are accessible.

[,ts]
----
var z = string | number = 'zero';

z = 0;
z= '

// NOK
// z = false
// Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
----

. We say that `z` can be either a string OR a number.
But it cannot be anything else, like <3>.
We are also initializing it to the string "`zero`".
. OK, it can be a number.
. Nope, it can't be a boolean.
It cannot be any other type that is not a string or a number.

== Intersection Types (AND)

Intersection types:

* Represent values that simultaneously have multiple types.
The compound type `A & B` is a value that is both of type `A` *AND* type `B`.
* Typically used for object types.
 ** `string & number` is effectively mutually exclusive.
* Can be very useful for function signatures.

Because this is an intersection type, it has to fully satisfy the one or the other.
You can't mix and match.

[,ts]

. Okay to call `f` with two strings.
. Okay to call `f` with two numbers.
. NOT okay to call `f` with any other combination of types.
It has to  fully satisfy the one of the other of the compound intersection  (product) type.
. ts error: no overload matches this call

  [tsserver 2769] [E] No overload matches this call.
    Overload 1 of 2, '(x: string, y: string): void', gave the following error.
      Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
    Overload 2 of 2, '(x: number, y: number): void', gave the following error.
      Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
----

. ts error (same as previous error)

== Tuples

*VIDEO*: Topic starts at https://youtu.be/wD5WGkOEJRs?t=563[9:33 in the video].

Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 introduced tuples and picked the _array syntax_ for them.

Tuples:

* Fixed-size collection of any different types ("`fixed-size array of flexible types`");
* Unnamed field names;
* Access using indices into fields;
* Structurally typed

Some languages now a days are starting to let individual fields of tuples to be named.

[,ts]
----
--8<--- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e07.ts"
----

. TypeScript knows the first element of the tuple is a string.
. TypeScript knows that the second element is a number, and that numbers don't have a  `substring` property/method.

!!!
warning

 `String.prototype.substr` [has been deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr).
 Prefer `String.prototype.substring` instead!

=== Destructuring Tuples

We can destructure these tuples:

* Locals can be declared as "`parts`" of a larger thing (such as tuples);
* Destructuring is shorthand syntax;
* Empty comma can ignore elements in the source;
* `+...+` (_spread_) can capture the "`rest`" into one element.

A two-tuple of a string and a number and destructuring example:

```ts title="simple destructuring" let tup: [string, number];
tup = ["Yoda", 1];
const [name, id] = tup;
log(name, id);
// → "Yoda", 1

----

A three-tuple of numbers, ignoring the second element in the
destructuring:

```ts title="ignoring elements when destructuring"
const nums: [number, number, number] = [1, 2, 3];
//          (1)
const [first, , third] = nums;
log(first, third);
// → 1, 3
----

. Not a typo.
We want to ignore the second value.

Destructuring example with `+...+` rest operator.

!!!
info

 I extended this example to include the numbers generator in an
 attempt to make it a little more interesting.

```ts title="destructuring with spread" /**

* A Generator function that produces numbers from `min` to `max`.
*
* @param ini The start of the range (inclusive).
* @param end The end of the range (inclusive).
* @returns The generator.
_/ function_ numsFromTo(   ini: number,   end: number, ): Generator<number, void, unknown> {   while (ini < end) yield ini{pp};
}

// <1>
const [head, ...tail] = [...numsFromTo(0, 9)];

log(head, tail);
// → 0
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

----

Note how we can use `...tail` to capture all the remaining values that
have not been handled earlier on in the destructuring.

## Enums

**VIDEO**: Topic starts at [12:13 in the video](https://youtu.be/wD5WGkOEJRs?t=733).

Enumerated types:

* Represents bound set of possible values;
* Backed by numeric value (usually starting and 0 and incrementing if not
  specified).
* At run time enums are objects;
* “const enum” are compile-time computed for efficiency.

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = 1, // (1)
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

const currentDirection = Direction.Down;

if (currentDirection === Direction.Down) {
  movePlayerDown(player);
}

const isOne = Direction.Up === 1;
log(isOne);
// → true
----

. Would be 0 if not explicitly set to start at 1.
