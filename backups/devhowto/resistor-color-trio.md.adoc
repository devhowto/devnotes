== v2 index of colors, extra variables

This solution uses the indexes of the colors as the values, so, instead of an object with `color: num`, we simply have an array of colors.

It also uses a bunch of extra variables for intermediary results.
The downside is that it is too many.
On the bright side, their names may help understanding the reasoning with the algorithm.

Also note that `band1` is in the ten's position, therefore, we multiply it by 10.
`band2` is in the one's position, and therefore we don't multiply it (or multiply it by 1).

== v3 less extra variables

This solution is similar to the previous one, except that instead of creating all the extra varaible to store intermediary results and name (making it more self-documenting) those results, we instead go with the approach of doing the multiplaction and additions without the extra variables.
It may be harder to understand, perhaps, but at least it reduces all those variables.
