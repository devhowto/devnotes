Yes, it is a hostile language (at least from a certain point of view).

People who write books use tiles and descriptions that imply that
their book is different. “Now you'll finally get it” because “this
book is written in such and such a way that will make it a no-brainer
for you to finally get it”. They say that “it is not that hard”, that
the problem is that “the other existing books are not easy for
beginners” and so on and so forth.

Getting started with Haskell is harder than in some other languages.
That is a fact. Let's not try to hide it. Let's acknowledge it and
deal with it.

People say that Lisp is easy, that you learn the sytnax in a few
minutes. Still, it takes uncountable hours of study and pratice to
actually get good at it (althout the same is true of any language, one
could argue).

It doesn't matter if it is hard or not. It is an amazing language,
created and improved by people who research in this area for more than
30 years. It also teaches one new ways of thinking, of accomplishing
things and solving problems. It is also a very unique language (in
many respects). It is worth studying and learning it. A new universe
awaits!
