== Structural vs Nominal Typing

*INFO*: This topic starts at https://youtu.be/wD5WGkOEJRs?t=34[0:34 in the video].

TypeScript operates by structural typing.
Two instances are type-equivalent if their contents are "`matchable`".
Other languages with similar syntax (C{pp}, Java, C#, etc.) use "`nominative typing`", or "`nominal typing`".

TypeScript compiler looks at the *members* of the things we are working with, not the *name*.

[,ts]
----
--8<-- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e02.ts"
----

. Because `y` requires a string and a number, but x only has a string, we get the error that `age` is missing in `x`.

Structural typing is the basis for many cool and interesting things in TypeScript (examplesâ€½), which we cannot do with nominal-typed languages.

== Type Assertion

We can use a *type assertion* to mean "`I want to use this as a string`".

[,ts]
----
--8<-- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e02.ts"
function getNameOrNum(): string | number {
  return (Date.now() % 2) === 0 ? "Twenty Seven" : 27;
}

let norn = getNameOrNum();

//
// Using type assertion. <1>
//
l(norn.valueOf());

// <3>
if ((<string>norn).substring) {
  log((<string>norn).substring(0, 5));
} else if ((<number>norn).toFixed) {
  log((<number>norn).toFixed(2));
}
----

. `someValue.valueOf` is available on almost any value.
+
null prototype
+
One exception is an object created with `null` as its prototype, which inherits nothing and therefore it nas no `valueOf` property:

 var obj = Object.create(null);
 obj.valueOf();
 Uncaught TypeError: obj.valueOf is not a function

. This is not an "`instance of`" test, because there is no inheritance relationship between string and number.

Note that we have to repeat the cast-like assertion to test the condition, and then again inside the if/else blocks.

== Type Guards

Type Guards are getting better and better over time.
Check the https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-4.html[release notes for TypeScript 4.4] for instance.

Besides type assertion (cast-like things), we can also make use of type guards for similar results.

[,ts]
----
--8<-- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e03.ts"
----

. Creates a type guard function that checks whether the given value is a string.
. Because we are using a type guard now, we don't need to assert/check the type again inside the if/else/then blocks.

== typeof Type Guards

We can also use type guards directly defined inside the body of a function (not defined as a separate type-guard function, like above).

[,ts]
----
--8<-- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e04.ts"
----

We could simplify the `padLeft` function:

[,ts]
----
--8<-- "src/typescript/ted-neward-advanced-typescript/e05.ts"
----

. Here the type guard is done using a simple condition.
It is not necessary to always create a type guard function.
Use your best judgement for each case.
. Because the TypeScript compiler is ridiculously clever, it knows that if the input isn't a number (from the guard in the `if` condition), then it can only be a string and we don't need another type guard here.
