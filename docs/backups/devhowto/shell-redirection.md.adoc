= Shell Redirection

== Intro

* `0` is the standard input, or STDIN;
* `1` is the starndard output, or STDOUT;
* `2` is the standard error, or STDERR;

In C, we can do things like this:

[,c]
----
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", "make: humans");

  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", "Something is wrong in this planet.");

  return 0;
}
----

In the shell, we use the `<` and `&` operators in combination with the numbers.

== stdout

When we print or echo something, it goes to stdout by default:

[,shell-session]
----
$ echo hey
hey

$ printf '%d\n' {1..3}
1
2
3
----

Same goes for `cat`.
By default, output goes to stdout:

[,shel-session]
----
$ cat <<EOF
> I'm $(whoami). My shell is $SHELL, version $BASH_VERSION.
> My main editor is $EDITOR, but I love Emacs too!
> EOF

My main editor is vim, but I love Emacs too!
