= tar command line examples
:description: Some practical examples on using the tar command to create and extract archives

== Unpack an archive to existing directory

Sometimes we want to unpack an archive directly into another directory instead of in the current directory.
For that we can use `--directory` or `-C`:

```text title="excerpt from man tar" -C, --directory=DIR       Change to DIR before performing any operations.
This option  is       order-sensitive, i.e.
it affects all options that follow.

----

We do it like this, but **note that the target directory must already exist**:

```shell-session title="unpack to directory"
$ tar \
    -xf exercism-linux-64bit.tgz \
    --directory ~/bin/exercism-linux/

$ ls -a1 !$
ls -A1 ~/bin/exercism-linux/
exercism*
LICENSE
README.md
shell/

== Unpack an archive to a directory that doesn't exist yet

In the case above, `~/bin/exercism-linux/` directory already existed and our command line worked as expected.
It seems `tar` (GNU tar 1.34, 2022), doesn't have a flag to create the target directory in case it doesn't exist yet.
In that case, the solution is to create it before extracting the archive**:

`shell-session title="mkdir && unpack to directory" $ mkdir -pv ~/bin/exercism-linux && \     -xf exercism-linux-64bit.tgz \     --directory ~/bin/exercism-linux/ `
