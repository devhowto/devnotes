== Intro

image:command-line-intro.assets/bash-help-1.png[Bash Help Command Line]

Command line tools have NOT faded out into the past. They have kept
consistently evolving and being improved. They still do! A lot of GUI
interfaces use command line tools behind the scenes.

There exists a specification to standardize how command line utilities
should behave so that they work in a cross-platform, interoperable way.

GNU and BSD command line utilities generally try to follow the specs but
add the so called _extensions_ which add further capabilities to the
tools, making writing scripts and programs easier and sometimes less
verbose, but also reduce the portability. Some tools can be run in a
more restrict way that disallow extensions. The docs for each tool
should specify those things. Information about these things is also
scattered across this website's notes and examples when they are deemed
important and/or worthwhile.

Besides reading the specs, also take a look at the sidebar about reading
and understanding man pages, info pages and help pages.

=== Yes, That Website Sucks

Yes, that website sucks. Not the contents of the website, but the way it
works!

The whole thing is full of iframes. URLs don't change (only the iframes
contents do) when we click on sidebar links which means it is impossible
to share or bookmark different URLs do. HOWEVER, if we *open links on a
new tab* then we get out of the iframe hell thing. So, open links on a
new tab when you need the URL for that link.

The examples on this site assume GNU tools and GNU Coreutils. If you
find something that doesn't work on your version/vendor of the tool,
feel free to open a PR to this project proposing an alternative working
solution.
