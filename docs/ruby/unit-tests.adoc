= Unit Tests :: Ruby

== Warning ``circular require considered harmful''

[NOTE]
====
This problem seems to only shows up if you use
`ruby -w` to run a given program.
====

Sometimes while practicing and writing algorithms, we write the unit tests and code in the same file (as we do with the https://htdp.org/[HtDP] https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html#%28form._%28%28lib._lang%2Fhtdp-beginner..rkt%29._check-expect%29%29[teaching languages]).

Something like this:

[source,rb]
----
#
# add.rb
#

##
# $ gem install rspec
# $ rspec add.rb
##
require 'rspec'

def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

describe 'add()' do
  it 'should add x and y' do
    expect(add(-1, 1)).to eq 0
  end
end
----

This is OK and works well.
Except if we then try to include the `add.rb` module into another module because you want to reuse the `add()` method, then we might get strange warnings with `ruby -w`:

[source,rb]
----
#
# sum_arr.rb
#
require 'awesome_print'
require_relative './add'
----

[source,text]
----
$ ruby -w sum-arr.rb

warning: loading in progress, circular require considered harmful
----

Note that `sum_arr.rb` does nothing but to require the two other files.
In this case, it seems something doesnâ€™t go along well between `awesome_print` and `add.rb` importing `rspec`.
Not requiring `awesome_print` in `sum_arr.rb` or not requiring `rspec` in `add.rb` causes the warning to cease.
