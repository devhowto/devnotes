== Intro

----
CREATE DATABASE simplysql_teamsgames_devel WITH
    ENCODING='UTF-8'

----

The `FROM` clause is what produces the resulting tabular structure, which is referred to as the _result set_ of the `FROM` clause.
It is sometimes also called the *_intermediate result set_* or *intermediate tabular result set*, as that result can be further worked on by other clauses.

Starting with the `FROM` clause makes sense because all the rest is "`derived`" from its result set and also because it is the first clause a database system looks into when evaluating queries.

A DBMS parses SQL queries into component clauses, then it examines the syntax according to the syntax rules of each clause.
The `FROM` clause is parsed first (rather than the `SELECT` clause, which comes first in the query syntax).

----
SELECT
    id
  , name
FROM users;
----

If `SELECT` was parsed and examined first, a DBMS would have to inspect *all* tables to see which ones would have `id` and `name` columns (and indeed, some column names occur in many tables, like `id`, for example).

By parsing and examining the `FROM` clause first, the DBMS can know right away which table(s) the columns are expected to be retrieved from.

The `FROM` clause can read from:

* single tables
* join tables
* views
* derived tables (a.k.a.
inline views) and subqueries

== FROM One Table

----
SELECT
    id
  , name
FROM teams;
----

There mus bet _at least_ one tabular structure to select from.

== FROM More Than One Table Using Joins

`JOIN` joins/combines/relates/associates two or more tables together (in one of several different ways), producing a _single tabular structure_.

The _type of join_ is specified in the `FROM` clause using keywords _as well as_ using the keyword `JOIN`.

A rule called a *join condition* is used to determine how the the results of the join are selected (to determine which rows should be joined).

== Types of JOIN

There are three types of joins with a total of five variations.

* _inner join_, using the `INNER JOIN` keywords (including old style join).
* _outer join_:
 * `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
 * `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
 * `FULL OUTER JOIN`
* _cross join_, created using the `CROSS JOIN` keywords

----
SELECT col_a FROM tbl_a;     SELECT col_b FROM tbl_b;
 col_a                             col_b
-------                           -------
   102                               101
   104                               102
   106                               104
   107                               106
(4 rows)                             108
                                  (5 rows)
----

Observe that 107 in tbl_a does not exist in tbl_b.
And 101 and 108 from tbl_b do not exist in tbl_a.

== INNER JOIN

For _inner join_, only rows satisfying the condition on the `ON` clause are returned in the result set.

----
SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a INNER JOIN tbl_b
ON col_a = col_b;

 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
(3 rows)
----

In this case, only rows which have the same value on both tables are returned.
Rows that _match_ the condition are returned.

=== WHERE clause JOIN (old style)

There is an "`old style`" type of join which is performed on the `WHERE` clause.
It is called "`old style join`", or "`comma list join`" or "`where clause join`" by people.

----
SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a, tbl_b
WHERE col_a = col_b;

 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
(3 rows)
----

This style only supports an inner join result.

== OUTER JOIN

If compared with *_inner joins_*, *outer joins* differ in the sense that *_unmatched_* rows can also be returned.+++<aside>+++ðŸ’¡ Outer joins include things that don't match, but also things that match (like if it was a more lax version of inner join).
Don't think that somehow outer joins are the opposite of inner joins.
Don't think like "`inner joins return rows that match, outer joins return rows that don't match.`" That is wrong.
Again, outer joins returns both rows that match or don't match.+++</aside>+++

=== LEFT OUTER JOIN

All rows on the left table are returned regardless they have a matching row on the right table.

Any table can be the left table or the right table.

----

SQL> \pset null '<null>'
Null display is "<null>".

SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl_b
ON col_a = col_b;

 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
   107 | <null>
(4 rows)

SQL> \pset null âˆ…
Null display is "âˆ…".
SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a LEFT OUTER JOIN tbl_b
ON col_a = col_b;
 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
   107 |     âˆ…
(4 rows)
----

All values from `col_a` are returned, as we made `tbl_a` the _left_ table.

107 in A does not have a matching value in B, but it was returned nonetheless because we used a _left outer join_ and made A the left table ðŸ™‚.
And because there is no matching value on the _right_ table, the result set includes a null value for it!

=== RIGHT OUTER JOIN

All rows on the right table are returned, regardless if they have a matching row on the left table.

----
SQL> \pset null âˆ…
Null display is "âˆ…".

SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a RIGHT OUTER JOIN tbl_b
ON col_a = col_b;

 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
     âˆ… |   101
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
     âˆ… |   108
(5 rows)
----

=== FULL OUTER JOIN

All rows are returned, regardless whether they have a matching row on the _other_ table.
It is the union of the result of the left and right outer joins.

----
SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b
FROM tbl_a FULL OUTER JOIN tbl_b
ON col_a = col_b;
 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   102
   104 |   104
   106 |   106
   107 |     âˆ…
     âˆ… |   108
     âˆ… |   101
(6 rows)
----

For a full outer join, it doesn't really mater which table is the left table and which one is the right table.

== CROSS JOIN

Every row for both tables are returned, regardless of whether they match, which is why there is no `ON` clause.

Every row on one table will be combined with every row on the other table.

----
SQL> SELECT col_a, col_b FROM tbl_a CROSS JOIN tbl_b;
 col_a | col_b
-------+-------
   102 |   101
   102 |   102
   102 |   104
   102 |   106
   102 |   108
   104 |   101
   104 |   102
   104 |   104
   104 |   106
   104 |   108
   106 |   101
   106 |   102
   106 |   104
   106 |   106
   106 |   108
   107 |   101
   107 |   102
   107 |   104
   107 |   106
   107 |   108
(20 rows)
----

It is the same as running this query (the results are exactly the same):

----
SELECT col_a, col_b FROM tbl_a, tbl_b;
----

== Real World Joins

=== INNER JOIN

----
SQL> SELECT
    categories.name
  , entries.title
  , entries.created
FROM categories INNER JOIN entries
  ON categories.category = entries.category;
           name           |            title            |       created

*IMPORTANT*: Fist, a `FROM` clause produces an intermediate tabular result set, then, the `SELECT` clause selects what will be in the final result set.

The FROM clause is parsed first, and it is also the one executed first.

We could also create aliases to make it a bit shorter:

----
SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , e.created
FROM categories AS c
  INNER JOIN entries AS e
    ON c.category = e.category;
----

But because we didn't use duplicate column names on the query, qualifying is not required for the examples above, and we could simplify to this:

----
SELECT
    name
  , title
  , created
FROM categories AS c
  INNER JOIN entries AS e
    ON c.category = e.category;
----

BUT...
tell me from which table is the column `name` coming from?
`categories` or `entries`?
What about `title`?
Is it the title of the category or the title of the entry?
And how about `created`?
Is it the created data of the category itself or the entry?
Because of this, it is recommended, and considered good practice, to "`always`" qualify columns (even when not required) when there are joins involved in the query.
Qualifying column names helps to make the queries more self-documenting.

After a table name is aliased, the original table name can no longer be used for that query.
If you make an alias, use the alias consistently for that query.

=== LEFT OUTER JOIN

----
SQL> \pset null âˆ…
Null display is "âˆ…".

SQL> SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , e.created
FROM categories AS c
  LEFT OUTER JOIN entries AS e
    ON c.category = e.category;

           name           |            title            |       created

Note the blog category does not have entries (yet), but its `name` column is still returned in the result set, and filled with null for the `title` and `created` columns on the `entries` table.

NULL is a special value in SQL which represents (or stands for) the _absence of a value_.
(not even an empty string).

=== RIGHT OUTER JOIN

----
SQL> SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , e.created
FROM categories AS c RIGHT OUTER JOIN entries AS e
    ON c.category = e.category;
           name           |            title            |       created

----

----
FROM categories AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN entries AS e

vs

FROM entries AS e RIGHT OUTER JOIN categories AS c
----

The "`outer`" table will be the one which will have all of its rows in the result set.

If we add an entry without a category, then the right outer join will show all entries and fill null âˆ… for missing rows on the categories table.

----
SQL> SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , created
FROM categories AS c RIGHT OUTER JOIN entries AS e
ON c.category = e.category;

=== FULL OUTER JOIN

NOTE: In MySQL versions around the year 2009, the full outer join syntax was not yet supported.

Full outer join include unmatched rows from both the left _and_ the right tables, because both tables are outer tables.

----
SQL> SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , created
FROM categories AS c FULL OUTER JOIN entries AS e
ON c.category = e.category;

           name           |            title            |       created

=== UNION Queries

If full outer joins are not supported by your DB vendor, a union query can help, even though they are not joins per se.
One can think of them as two result sets concatenated together.

The basic idea for the syntax is

----
...left outer join...
UNION
...right outer join...
----

----
SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , e.created
FROM categories AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN entries AS e
ON c.category = e.category
UNION
SELECT
    c.name
  , e.title
  , created
FROM categories AS c RIGHT OUTER JOIN entries AS e
ON c.category = e.category;

           name           |            title            |       created

Observe the the use of `LEFT` and `RIGHT` outer joins, and the use of `UNION` between the two `SELECT` clauses.

Because the `SELECT` clauses are not on their own, but rather _subordinate_ to the `UNION` query, The `SELECT` clauses are called *subselects* in this context.
They can sometimes more or less informally be referred to as subqueries in this context.

A join is like an horizontal concatenation where columns are appended/concatenated to the right (or left), while a union is more like a vertical concatenation, where rows are appended/concatenated to the end of the first result set.
And duplicates are removed.

image::unions-sets-2023-10-16T11-50-18-246Z.png[Union, Sets]

Because `UNION` removes duplicate rows, there is also `UNION ALL` which doesn't bother removing duplicate rows, which means it is faster (even though it produces a larger result set) because it doesn't have to scan for duplicate rows.

A union is somewhat like a full outer join and can be used when a DB vendor does not support full outer joins.

Union queries, like join queries, produce a tabular result set.

== Views

----
CREATE VIEW entries_with_category AS
SELECT
    entries.title
  , entries.created
  , categories.name AS category_name
FROM entries
INNER JOIN categories
ON entries.category = categories.category;
----

Now we can select from the view, just like if it was a table:

----
SELECT
    title
  , created
  , category_name
FROM entries_with_category;

title            |       created       |      category_name

(5 rows)
----

When we select from a view, the underlying queries for that view are executed, and stored in an intermediate tabular result set, to which the original `FROM` then reads from.

Only column names defined in the view are available to queries that use the view.
Columns from the original tables are hidden.

== Subqueries and Derived Tables

Derived tables are temporary tables created with subqueries.
Derived tables are sometimes called *inline views* as they are like an on-the-fly, temporary view.

----
SELECT
    title
  , category_name
FROM
  (
        SELECT
                entries.title
      , entries.created
      , categories.name AS category_name
    FROM categories INNER JOIN entries
        ON categories.category = entries.category
  ) AS entries_with_categories;

            title            |      category_name

The subquery (inside parentheses) was given a name using `AS` at the end.
It produces a tabular structure, and `FROM` can read from any tabular structure.
