== git push stale info
date: 2022-10-28, Fri

Occasionally one runs `git push <remote> <branch>` and gets some sort of message about “stale info”.

Sometimes a branch is deleted on the remote repo after it is merged, and `push --force-with-lease` will result in the “stale info” problem thing (because we cannot “force with lease” on a branch that doesn't exist on the remote).

Also if someone renames an organization/group or repository in Github or Gitlab (or other vendors), then `git push` will fail with a similar “stale info” message.

To fix the problem, sometimes a simple `git fetch` first or setting the new remote URL will suffice.
