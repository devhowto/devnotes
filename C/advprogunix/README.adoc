Read `man man` and understand about manual sections.

.Exerpt of `man man`:

[source,text]
----
The  table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types
of pages they contain.

1   Executable programs or shell commands
2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
6   Games
7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages  and  conventions),  e.g.  man(7),
    groff(7), man-pages(7)
8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
9   Kernel routines [Non standard]
----

So for example, we could have `printf` in section 1 for user shell commands, and `printf` in section 3 for the C library function.
`write` is found on section 1, but also on section 2 as a system call function.
And so on and so forth.
