== Warnings, Pedantic

Unless otherwise noted, assume the the compiler flags include:

* `-std=c99`
* `-Og`
* `-g3`
* `-Wall`
* `-Wextra`
* `-Wpedantic`
* `-fsanitize=address,undefined`

== Return status vs exit status

The ANSI C standard has no value for true and false.
C programs treat the value 0 as false, and any other value as true.
The C99 standard does allow you to use the words true and false in your programs—but the compiler treats them as the values 1 and 0 anyway.

If your function returns 0, it means success.
Any other values signals some sort of failure or malfunction.

0 is success for a return value (or exit status on shell scripts for example), even though it also means “false”.
1 is some kind of error (again, even on shell script exit status), even though it also means “true”.

== Tooling

=== bear

Bear is able to generate an LLVM/Clangd compilation database from intercepted commands, such as `make <target>`.

See link:https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear[rizsotto/Bear^] repo.

On Arch Linux:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ pacman --sync --refresh --needed bear
----

Create a `compile_commands.json` from a `Makefile`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ bear -- make foo
----

The result will be a `compile_commands.json` in the current directory which contains the build info for the `foo` `make` target.

== Criterion

link:https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/releases[Download Criterion^] (if not installing from AUR or the package manager of
your distro), and extract it to `$HOME/local/clibs`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ mkdir -pv ~/local/clibs
mkdir: created directory '/home/devel/local/clibs'

$ cd $?

$ \curl -LO https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/releases/download/v2.4.2/criterion-2.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz

$ tree -C ./
./
└── criterion-2.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz

1 directory, 1 file

$ tar -vxf ./criterion-2.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
criterion-2.4.2/
criterion-2.4.2/lib/
criterion-2.4.2/lib/libcriterion.so.3.2.0
criterion-2.4.2/lib/pkgconfig/
...

$ rm -v ./criterion-2.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
removed './criterion-2.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.xz'
----

And maybe rename `criterion-<version>` to simply `criterion` to make
later commands easier:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ mv -v ./criterion{-2.4.2,}
renamed './criterion-2.4.2' -> './criterion'
----

Then, C files including Criterion tests must compiled with correct flags
to include Criterion header files and proper linking:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ make -f ./Makefile_dev \
  ./out/spin_words_v1 && LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$HOME/local/clibs/criterion/lib"

$ gcc \
  -std=c99 \
  -Og \
  -g3 \
  -Wall \
  -Wextra \
  -Wpedantic \
  -fsanitize=address,undefined \
  -I ~/local/clibs/criterion/include \
  -L ~/local/clibs/criterion/lib \
  -lcriterion \
  ./myapp.c \
  -o ./myapp
----

And when running the compiled code, specify Creterion's library path:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$HOME/local/clibs/criterion/lib" \
  ./myapp
----

Of course, those can be set in the shell rc files and used in
combination with tools like `make`:

In `~/.bashrc`:

[source,shell-session]
----
export CLIBS="$HOME/devel/clibs"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CLIBS/criterion/lib"
----

And an example `Makefile`:

[source,shell-session]
----
CLIBS=$(HOME)/local/clibs
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-std=c99 \
	-Og \
	-g3 \
	-Wall \
	-Wextra \
	-Wpedantic \
	-fsanitize=address,undefined \
	-I $(CLIBS)/criterion/include \
	-L $(CLIBS)/criterion/lib \
	-l criterion
./out:
	mkdir -pv ./out

./out/%: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -rfv ./out/*
----

Then we can simply do:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ make ./out
$ make ./out/myapp
$ ./out/myapp
----
