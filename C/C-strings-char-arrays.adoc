= C Strings and Char Arrays

== Char Arrays

* Signed char (negative and positive).
  1 byte.
  stem:[\frac{2^8}{2} = \frac{256}{2}], from -128 to 127.
* Unsigned char (only positive).
  1 byte.
  stem:[2^8 = 256], from 0 to 255.

[TIP]
====
Why unsigned chars range from -128 to 127 (and not to 128)?

Because 0 is part of the positives in this context.
stem:[0 + 127] totals 128 individual integers.

Same with stem:[2^8 = 256] but then the range goes from 0 to 255 (not 0 to 256).
Again that is because stem:[0 + 255] totals 256 individual integers.

'''
Question: Why the type `char` limits representation in integers?

Answer: Because charsets like ASCII assigned a constant integer value to represent symbols, letters, punctuation, etc.
All charsets use integers to represent these symbols.

Question: How can a symbol be stored in a 1-byte memory?

Because 8 bits is one byte. 2 (bits 0 and 1) to the 8th power (number of bits in a byte) is 256 (0 to 255).
At the time this was enough to represent american English letters, symbols and punctuation.


== Strings

This is a char 'z' and the NUL terminator `\0`:

[source,c]
----
char s[] = "z"
----

And this:

[source,c]
----
char a[] = "z";
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(a));

char b[1] = "z";
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(b));
----

`a` has the size 2: `'z'` and `'\0'`.
The preprocessor counts the chars plus the space for the NUL terminator and allocates the necessary space.

`b`, on the other hand, has the size 1: the storage for the array was explicitly said to be 1.
So `b` is allocated memory for one byte, the char 'z' is stored and the NUL byte has nowhere to go, and is not part of `b`.

== Strings as function parameters

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

void fn(char s[]) {
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof s);
}

int main() {
  char str[4] = { 'T', 'u', 'x', '\0' };

  printf("%ld\n", sizeof str);

  fn(str);

  return 0;
}
----

In `main()`, `sizeof str` produces 4 because the char array / string contains 4 characters.

In `fn()`, `sizeof s` produces 8 because a pointer to char takes 8 bytes on the machine where this code was run.

Arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions.

Also, declaring a function parameter with the `arg[]` syntax is misleading because it looks like an array, but for that function, it `arg` is a pointer.

[source,c]
----
void fn(char s[]) {
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof s);
}
----

The above even produces warnings with `-Wall`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall ex01.c -o outdir/ex01
ex01.c: In function ‘fn’:
ex01.c:4:26: warning: ‘sizeof’ on array function parameter ‘s’ will return size of ‘char *’ [-Wsizeof-array-argument]
    4 |   printf("%ld\n", sizeof s);
      |                          ^
ex01.c:3:14: note: declared here
    3 | void fn(char s[]) {
      |         ~~~~~^~~
----

Delcare it like this instead:

[source,c]
----
void fn(char *s) {
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof s);
}
----

== Arrays are CONSTANT pointers

People say “an array name is a pointer to its first element”.
This is only partially true:

[source,c]
----
int main() {
  char str[4] = { 'T', 'u', 'x', '\0' };
  char *p = str;

  printf("%c\n", *(str + 1));
  printf("%c\n", *(++p));
  printf("%c\n", *(++str)); // <1>
}
----

1. error: lvalue required as increment operand

An array name is a *constant* pointer.
We can do `*(arr + 1)`, but not `*arr++` or `*(++arr)`.
