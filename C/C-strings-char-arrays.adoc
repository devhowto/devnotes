= C Strings and Char Arrays
:toc: right

This is a char 'z' and the NUL terminator `\0`:

[source,c]
----
char s[] = "z"
----

And this:

[source,c]
----
char a[] = "z";
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(a));

char b[1] = "z";
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(b));
----

`a` has the size 2: `'z'` and `'\0'`.
The preprocessor counts the chars plus the space for the NUL terminator and allocates the necessary space.

`b`, on the other hand, has the size 1: the storage for the array was explicitly said to be 1.
So `b` is allocated memory for one byte, the char 'z' is stored and the NUL byte has nowhere to go, and is not part of `b`.
