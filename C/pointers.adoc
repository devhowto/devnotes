== Intro

`*` is used both to declare a pointer _and_ to access the value the pointer points to.
When it means each is determined by the context.

`int *p = &x` causes `p` to point to the memory address of `x`.

`printf("%d", \*p)` means “look for the address stored in `p` and retrieve the value stored at that address.”
In other words, *read* the value stored at `p`.

`*p = 5` replaces the old value at `p` with 5.

`&` and `*` are opposites.
The former gives the address of something, while the latter gives the value stored at some address.

Pointers are also known as _references_ (to addresses).
`\*` is said to *dereference* a pointer.

== Print pointer address with %p

.invalid type for %p
[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
  int *p;
  int x = 3;
  p = &x;

  printf("p addr: %p\n", p);
  printf("*p val: %i\n", *p);
}

.compiling

$ make ./outdir/ex01ptr
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic ex01ptr.c -o outdir/ex01ptr
ex01ptr.c: In function ‘main’:

Replace:

[source,c]
----
printf("%p", p);
----

with:

[source,c]
----
printf("%p", (void *)p);
----

On Arch Linux:

.man 3 printf on Arch Linux as of 2022
----
p   The void * pointer argument is printed in
    hexadecimal (as if by %#x or %#lx).
