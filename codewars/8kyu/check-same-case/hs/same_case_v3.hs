-- If both chars are letters, then check if the have the same
-- case by the clever `isLower c1 == isLower c2` logic.
--
-- We could have used isUpper and the results would
-- be correct just the same.
--
-- If both isLower is True, True == True is True.
-- If both are NOT isLower, False == False is also True.
-- If any has a different case, we'll end up with something
-- like True == False which is False.
--
-- Finally, fromEnum True is 1, and fromEnum False is 0. There's
-- the solution. The first guard returns either 0 or 1. -1 is
-- returned in case not both chars are letters at the end.
