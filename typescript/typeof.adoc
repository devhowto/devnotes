== Intro

In TypeScript, `typeof` can be used at both *value/expression context* and in *type context*.

In value context, we are back in JS land.
It produces a string identifying the type of identifiers (names of variables and functions), properties *and* expressions.

=== typeof in value context

*In type context, `typeof` cannot take expressions* (since expressions can only be evaluated at runtime and TS types are not present at runtime as they are erased during transpilation).

.node repl
----
> typeof 1
'number'
> typeof 'z'
'string'
> typeof {}
'object'
> typeof []
'object'
> typeof Symbol('foo')
'symbol'

> var o = { id: 1, name: 'Ahsoka Tano' }
> typeof o.id
'number'
> typeof o.name
'string'

> var xs = [1, 'two', { three: 3 }];
undefined
> typeof xs[0]
'number'
> typeof xs[1]
'string'
> typeof xs[2]
'object'
----

The above are all *runtime* type checks, vanilla JS type stuff.

=== typeof in type context

In type context, `typeof` can work with identifiers (variables, names of functions) or properties, but not with expressions.
These are errors:

----
type T = typeof 1;
                ~
      ~ Identifier expected.

type U = typeof (1 + '1');
                ~
      ~ Identifier expected.
----

`1` is an expression.
So is `1 + '1'`.

These work:

[source,typescript]
----
const x = 1;
type X = typeof x;

let y = 1;
type Y = typeof y;

var z = 1;
type Z = typeof z;

const v = 1 + '1';
type V = typeof v;

const o = { id: 1, name: 'Ahsoka Tano' };
type ID = typeof o.id;
type NAME = typeof o.name;
----

**NOTE**: Because we cannot reassign `x` (`const` was used with a literal assignment), the type is the literal 1, not “number”.

**NOTE**: Even though we did `const o`, the object properties can be changed so the inferred types are “number” and “string”.
If we do an `as const` type assertion at the end of the declaration, the types would be the literal number “1” and the string “Ahsoka Tano”.
