== Indexes

_Indexing_ is the first thing that comes to mind when trying to improve performance of queries.

A *table scan* is the process of reading through all tables (and should be avoided if possible).

An *indexed retrieval* is much more performant, as the RDBMS (Relation Database Management System) does not need to read though all rows, but goes directly to the desired rows.
