`FROM` clause produces a tabular structure, a.k.a.
_result set_.

The `WHERE` clause is optional, but when present, acts like a filter on the rows of the result set produced by the `FROM` clause.

The `WHERE` clause, more than any other clause, determines how performant our queries will be.

== Conditions

----
WHERE <condition that evaluate as TRUE>
----

Example:

----
SELECT name
FROM teams
WHERE id = 9;
----

A condition is some expression that can be evaluated by the database system, which may result in `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`.

The `WHERE` clause evaluates the truth of the condition for every row.

Only one row can possibly have the 9 as its `id` (as IDs have to be unique, no two entities can have the same ID).

`FROM` produces all rows, then the condition _filters out_ all rows whose `id` is not 9.
It returns `FALSE` for those rows.
Only the row with `id = 9` will produce `TRUE`.

----
SELECT name
FROM teams
WHERE NOT id = 9;

SELECT name
FROM teams
WHERE id <> 9;
----

`NOT` negates the truthy value.
`<>` can be read as "`less than or greater than 9 (but not 9).`"

The condition expressions have to produce `TRUE`, even though we want all rows where `id = 9` is `FALSE`.

A `WHERE` clause can include a `NOT` keyword.
And several conditions logically connected form a *compound condition*.

Avoid using the non-standard `!=`, supported by some DB vendors.

[TIP]
====
PostgreSQL DB dumps are on my cloud share.
====

`NULL` can mean a few things (have several interpretations), including _unknown_, _not applicable_, _missing_ (in case of outer joins).
For the `items` table, when the price is `NULL`, the best interpretation is _unknown_.

If an item has price 2.22, then `WHERE price = 2.22` is `TRUE`, and `WHERE price = 2.21` is `FALSE`.
If `price` is `NULL`, the result is `FALSE` (as 2.22 is not `NULL`), but we can also say it is `UNKNOWN`, as the price of the item itself is `UNKNOWN``.

The SQL standard says that `NULL` is not equal to anything, including another `NULL`.
Similar to `NaN` in ECMAScript, which is not equal to anything, including not being equal to itself:

.psql session to test NULL
[source,text]
----
SQL> \pset null '‚àÖ'
Null display is "‚àÖ".
SQL> SELECT 1 = 1 AS res;
 res
-----
 t
(1 row)

SQL> SELECT 1 = NULL AS res;
 res
-----
 ‚àÖ
(1 row)

SQL> SELECT NULL = NULL AS res;
 res
-----
 ‚àÖ
(1 row)
----

.node REPL session to test NaN
[source,text]
----
> 1 === NaN
false
> NaN === NaN
false
> Number.isNaN(NaN)
true
----

``NULL``'s are a tricky topic.
The `WHERE` clause only retains rows for which the condition evaluates to `TRUE`, so conditions that evaluate to `FALSE` _or_ `UNKNOWN` are filtered out nonetheless.

== Operators

There are other operators besides the ‚Äúequal to‚Äù (`=`) and the ‚Äúnot equal to‚Äù  (the standard `<>` or the non-standard `!=`).

=== Comparison Operators

Besides equality, it is possible to check whether a value is _less than_ or _more than_ some other value.

These operators can be used with numbers, strings and dates.
Numbers are compared in numerically, strings alphabetically, and dates chronologically.

equal to:: `=`
not equal to:: `<>` (or the non-standard `!=`)
less than:: `<`
less than or equal to:: `pass:[<=]`
greater than:: `>`
greater than or equal to:: `>=`

[TIP]
====
Text and strings are compared based on the __collating sequence__ or simply __collation__.

See:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation[Collation (Wikipedia)^]
* link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html[Collation Support (PostgreSQL Docs)^]
* link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/setting-character-sets-and-collations/[Setting Character Sets and Collations (MariDB docs)^]
====

For example, to filter based on a created date greater than or equal to some date:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    id
  , title
  , created
FROM entries
WHERE created >= '2009-01-01';
----

[source,example]
----
 id  |            title            |       created
-----+-----------------------------+---------------------
 537 | Be Nice to Everybody        | 2009-03-02 00:00:00
 573 | Hello Statue                | 2009-03-17 00:00:00
 598 | The Size of Our Galaxy      | 2009-04-03 00:00:00
 524 | Uncle Karl and the Gasoline | 2009-02-28 00:00:00
(4 rows)
----

=== The LIKE Operator

The `LIKE` operator allows for pattern matching on strings using wild card characters.

In standard SQL, `LIKE` provides two wildcards:

The underscore ‚Äò`_`‚Äô:: Match exactly one character (similar to
‚Äò`.`‚Äô in regex).
Percent sign ‚Äò`%`‚Äô:: Match zero or more characters (similar to ‚Äò`.*`‚Äô in regex).

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    name
  , type
FROM items
WHERE name LIKE 'thing%';
----

[source,text]
----
    name     |  type
-------------+---------
 thingie     | widgets
 thingamajig | widgets
 thingamabob | doodads
 thingum     | gizmos
----

Match ‚Äúthing‚Äù followed by any (and only) two other characters:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    name
  , type
FROM items
WHERE name LIKE 'thing__';
----

[source,text]
----
  name   |  type
---------+---------
 thingie | widgets
 thingum | gizmos
----

=== The BETWEEN Operator

The `BETWEEN` operator checks if a value is between the range of two values, inclusive.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    name
  , type
  , price
FROM items
WHERE price BETWEEN 4.00 AND 10.00
ORDER BY price ASC;
----

[source,text]
----
    name    |  type   | price
------------+---------+-------
 folderol   | doodads |  4.00
 gewgaw     | widgets |  5.00
 jigger     | gizmos  |  6.00
 thingie    | widgets |  9.37
 gimmick    | doodads |  9.37
 dingbat    | gizmos  |  9.37
 knickknack | doodads | 10.00
----

Note that `WHERE price BETWEEN 4 and 10` is the same as:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE price >= 5 AND price <= 10
----

Or

[source,sql]
----
WHERE 5 <= price AND price <= 10
----

And to select something since the last 3 days:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT title, created
FROM entries
WHERE created BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 5 DAY
              AND CURRENT_DATE;
----

PostgreSQL's syntax is something like `INTERVAL '5 days'`.

[WARNING]
====
When selecting between time intervals, make sure the earlier date comes before the later date, or no matches will be returned.
====

An example with constant dates:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT title, created
FROM entries
WHERE created BETWEEN '2001-01-01' AND '2001-01-23';
----

For February, that can have 28 or 29 days, it is probably best to use compound condition with an _open-ended upper end point_:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT title, created
FROM entries
WHERE '2009-02-01' <= created AND created < '2009-03-01';
----

Note the correct use of `pass:[<=]` and `<` for this particular case.
We calculate the first day of the following month, but do not include it in the results ü§£.
This query will correctly match a date range that includes all the days in the month of February.
Clever and simple at the same time.

== Compound Conditions with AND and OR

=== OR

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name
FROM masters
WHERE name = 'Aayla Secura'
  OR  name = 'Ahsoka Tano';
----

=== AND

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, level
FROM masters
WHERE name = 'Yoda'
AND level = 100;
----

[WARNING]
====
`AND` has higher precedence than `OR`.
====

This query:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE c1 = A OR c1 = B
  AND c2 = C
----

Especially because the first `OR` and the two first equality comparisons are write on their on line, it is easy to think this query means this:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE (c1 = A OR c1 = B) AND c2 = C
----

But it actually means this:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE c1 = A OR (c2 = B AND c3 = C)
----

That is because `AND` has higher precedence than `OR`.

[TIP]
====
It may be good advice to use explicit parenthesis when writing compound conditions with `AND` and `OR`.
It will improve understanding and reduce the chance of some semantic errors.
====

== Conditional ANDs and ORs

Sometimes applications need to create `WHERE` clause in which conditions are optional (particularly for search forms).

Because the `WHERE` clause requires at least one condition expression, instead of writing complicated logic to know whether or not a `WHERE` clause will be needed, you may like these better:

* For ``WHERE ... AND``, simply start with `WHERE 1 = 1` and then conditionally continue with any ``AND``'s that may be required.
* Similarly, for ``WHERE ... OR``, start with `WHERE 1 = 0` and then conditionally add any `OR`'s that may be required.

== IN Conditions

The `IN` condition checks if _any_ of the values inside the parentheses match, the condition evaluates as `TRUE`.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, level
FROM masters
WHERE name IN ('Aayla Secura', 'Ahsoka Tano')
AND battle_count > 7;
----

It is like the `IN` condition reads as ‚Äúif this, or this, or this other, etc.‚Äù

.From Simply SQL book
[source,sql]
----
WHERE
  customers.name IN ('A. Jones', 'B. Smith')
    AND items.name = 'thingum';
----

And to negate the condition, one of these are valid:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, level
FROM masters
WHERE NOT (name IN ('Aayla Secura', 'Ahsoka Tano'))

SELECT name, level
FROM masters
WHERE name NOT IN ('Aayla Secura', 'Ahsoka Tano')
----

Note that `NOT` does not work with all operators:

.OK
[source,sql]
----
WHERE name = 'Aayla Secura'
----

.NOT OK
[source,sql]
----
WHERE name NOT = 'Aayla Secura'
----

== IN with Subqueries

A query creates a tabular structure.
If we use a query that returns a single-column structure, that tabular result set can be passed as the data for the `IN` condition.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  cartitems.item_id
FROM
  cartitems
INNER JOIN carts
  ON carts.id = cartitems.cart_id
WHERE carts.customer_id = 750;
----

----
 item_id
---------
    5913
    5912
    5937
    5913
----

We now have a list of item IDs (note 5913 shows up twice; maybe that customer bought it more than once).

Let's feed that result to a query to get those items' names using an `IN` condition:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id
, name
FROM
  items
WHERE
  id IN (
    SELECT
      cartitems.item_id
    FROM
      cartitems
    INNER JOIN carts
      ON carts.id = cartitems.cart_id
    WHERE
      carts.customer_id = 750
  );
----

In the end, the `IN` with the subquery is just like this:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id
, name
FROM
  items
WHERE
  id IN (5913, 5912, 5937, 5913);
----

As a reminder, a subquery produces a result which, ‚Äúfrom the eyes of the man query‚Äù, is just like a table the outer query can select from.

== Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery is one that refers to (and therefore is dependent on) the parent query to be valid.

It makes a reference, via a correlation variable, to the outer main query.

A query that selects the latest entry (based on the `created` date) for each category:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  title
, category
, created
FROM
  entries AS t
WHERE
  created = (
    SELECT
      MAX(created)
    FROM
      entries
    WHERE
      category = t.category
  );
----

Because of the `t.category`, it is like if it will _loop_ and find the latest entry for each category in turn.

Each entry's created date is compared with the max created date returned for the subquery.
Instead of something like

[source,text]
----
WHERE created = '2001-01-23'
----

we instead compare created with the resultant date produced by the correlated subquery

[source,text]
----
WHERE created = <resulting date from subquery>
----

In other words, if the entry's created date is the equal to the created date found by the subquery, that entry is returned in the result set.

A subquery is tied to an object from the outer, main query.
A join is part of the main query.
Otherwise, they are similar and in many cases, correlated subqueries can be rewritten as joins.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  t.title
, t.category
, t.created
FROM
  entries AS t
    INNER JOIN (
      SELECT
        category
      , MAX(created) AS maxdate
      FROM
        entries
      GROUP BY category
    ) AS m
      ON m.category = t.category
        AND m.maxdate = t.created;
----

The subquery produces one row per category, and each row contains the latest date for that category (which is aliased as a derived table `m`)

== EXISTS

Similar to an `IN` condition with a subquery, the `EXISTS` condition merely needs the subquery to return _any_ rows at all in order for it to evaluate to `TRUE`.

Select all customers which have items in the cart:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id
, name
FROM
  customers
WHERE
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 AS yes
      FROM
        carts
      WHERE
        carts.customer_id = customers.id
    );
----

Select all customers which do not have items in the cart:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id
, name
FROM
  customers
WHERE
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 AS yes
      FROM
        carts
      WHERE
        carts.customer_id = customers.id
    );
----

Or with a join and `IS NULL`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  C.name
FROM
  customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN carts
  ON customers.id = carts.customer_id
WHERE carts.customer_id IS NULL;
----

== The End
