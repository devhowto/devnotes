My notes and code samples from link:https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/[The Nature of Code 2nd edition^].

== Setup

Download link:https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases[p5.js] and place it next to this `README.adoc` file.
The `.html` file includes the `p5.js` file.

== Commits

The commit message uses "noc" (nature of code) as the type and the chapter number as the scope. E.g:

[source,text]
----
noc(00): First example
noc(00): Move ball
noc(01): Message here
noc(07): Message...
----

When it makes sense, also include a body as well:

[source,text]
----
noc(00): First example

This change introduces the first example of how to properly setup
p5.js with a simple HTML page and how to use the `setup()` and
`draw()` functions.
