Let's refactor the `article_should_be_published` method below.

[source,ruby]
----
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :article
  validates :name, :email, :body, presence: true
  validate :article_should_be_published

  after_create :email_article_author

  def article_should_be_published
    if article && !article.published?
      errors.add(:article_id, 'is not published yet')
    end
  end

  def email_article_author
    p "TODO: Email -> #{article.user.email} replied in your article."
  end
end
----

Is more idiomatic if done like this:

.using unless
[source,ruby]
----
def article_should_be_published
  return unless article && article.published?

  errors.add(:article_id, 'is not published yet')
end
----

Or maybe using the link:https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/doc/syntax/calling_methods_rdoc.html#label-Safe+Navigation+Operator[safe navigation operator^]:

.unless and safe navigation
[source,ruby]
----
def article_should_be_published
  return unless article&.published?

  errors.add(:article_id, 'is not published yet')
end
----

In the two _improved_ approaches, we do away with a _do/end_ block and therefore *un-nest* the main logic to add the error to `errors`.
Less nesting is almost always a good thing.
