== Intro

[quote, Ash, Alien 1978]

Hello world
You still don't understand what you are dealing with, do you?

A survivor.
Unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.
A perfect organism!

It's structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.

I admire it's purity.

It seems Ash was really talking about Haskell üòÖ.

Yes, it is a hostile language (at least from a certain point of view).

People who write books use tiles and descriptions that imply that their book is different.
‚ÄúNow you‚Äôll finally get it‚Äù because ‚Äúthis book is written in such and such a way that will make it a no-brainer for you to finally get it‚Äù.
They say that ‚Äúit is not that hard‚Äù, that the problem is that ‚Äúthe other existing books are not easy for beginners‚Äù and so on and so forth.

Getting started with Haskell is harder than in some other languages.
That is a fact.
Let‚Äôs not try to hide it.
Let‚Äôs acknowledge it and deal with it.

People say that Lisp is easy, that you learn the syntax in a few minutes
Still, it takes uncountable hours of study (years) and practice to actually get good at it (although the same is true of any language, one could argue).

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it is hard or not.
It is an amazing language, created and improved by people who do research in this area for more than 30 years (and counting).
It also teaches one new ways of thinking, of accomplishing things and solving problems.
It is also a very unique language (in many respects).
It is worth studying and learning it.
A new universe awaits!

== Identifier names

Identifiers like `+xs+` or `+ys+` mean `+x+` or `+y+` _in plural form_, hinting it is some sort of list or collection of values.
Sometimes, a variation `+lox+` is also used (based on the book How To Design Programs ideas), meaning a ‚Äúlist of x‚Äù.
So we would have things like `+lon+` for a ‚Äúlist of numbers‚Äù or ‚Äúlou‚Äù maybe meaning a ‚Äúlist of users‚Äù.
It all depends on the context.
Here‚Äôs one example:

[source,haskell]
----
myZipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
myZipWith f xs ys = go f xs ys []
  where
    go :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [c]
    go _ [] _ acc                 = acc
    go _ _ [] acc                 = acc
    go fn (x : lox) (y : loy) acc = go fn lox loy (acc ++ [(fn x y)])
----

One important note is that *some times we intentionally use bad identifiers* (names of variables, functions, types, interfaces, whatever) *on purpose*.
We do this so that we are forced carefully think in terms of types and code, deeply contemplating their implications.
Good names, like `+add1+` or `+filter+` give away what the code is doing (of course this is what we do for production code), but may defeat the purpose of a question or exercise.

Take a look at this piece of Haskell code:

[source,hs]
----
h :: Integer -> Integer
h 0 = 1
h n = n * h (n - 1)
----

What does the function `+h+` do?
You have to really read and understand what it does step by step to know what it is really doing.

What if I write it this way?

[source,haskell]
-----
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
-----

Let‚Äôs try another one.
What does the function `+f+` do?

[source,hs]
----
f :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a
f n = go n 0
  where go n acc
          | n == 0 = acc
          | otherwise = go (n - 1) (acc + n)
----

[source,haskell]
----
sumUpTo :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a
sumUpTo n = go n 0
where go n acc
         | n == 0 = acc
         | otherwise = go (n - 1) (acc + n)
----

If we just see a nice name, it primes our brain to think like ‚ÄúYeah, I understand this‚Äù, but some times, *we don‚Äôt really understand it*.

Again, for real, production code, we ought to spend whatever time it takes to come up with the best possible names.
But when studying, depending on the purpose of the given question, exercise or situation, occasionally the good naming of identifiers defeats the whole goal.

The idea is that in certain situations, purposefully using non-meaningful names ends up forcing us to pay close attention to the whole code, flow, types, etc., making the entire experience harder, but much more prone to actually teaching us something.
