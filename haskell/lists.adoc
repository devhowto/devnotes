== Intro

Lists are a recursive series or *cons cells* `a : [a]` terminated by the empty list `[]`.

== Spine

When talking about lists, we also talk about the _spine_ and the _cons cells_.

The spine is the conceptual structure that holds the cons cells together.

Some functions (like `length`) work based on the spine and _does not_ force (evaluate) the values (cons cells).

Here, we cons a few numbers onto the empty list.
The values are 1, 2, 3 and `[]`.

[source,haskell]
----
1 : 2 : 3 : []
----

When we use the sugar list syntax, we can cause a make a value to be `undefined` (bottom, ⊥):

We can add the `undefined` ⊥ (bottom) value as a value in a list:

[source,haskell]
----
1 : 2 : undefined : 4 : []
----

And compute the length of that list (which does not force the values):

[source,text]
----
λ> length $ 1 : 2 : undefined : 4 : []
4
----

But if we use a function that forces (evaluates) the values, then it errors out:

----
λ> take 2 $ 1 : 2 : undefined : 4 : []
[1,2]

λ> take 3 $ 1 : 2 : undefined : 4 : []
[1,2,*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:74:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at <interactive>:25:18 in interactive:Ghci17
----

Note how the REPL even tried to print the list, and it printed `[1,2,` and then the exception happened because the next forced value was ⊥.

We can also make ⊥ be part of the spine:

[source,text]
----
λ> take 2 $ 1 : 2 : [] ++ undefined ++ 4 : []
[1,2]

λ> take 3 $ 1 : 2 : [] ++ undefined ++ 4 : []
[1,2*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:74:14 in base:GHC.Err
    undefined, called at <interactive>:32:24 in interactive:Ghci19
----

And when ⊥ is part of the spine, `length` (or other functions that evaluate the spine) won't work:

[source,text]
----
λ> length $ 1 : 2 : [] ++ undefined ++ 4 : []
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:74:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at <interactive>:33:24 in interactive:Ghci19
----

== Spine and Non-Strict Evaluation

* https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/

We talk about a list’s _spine_ when talking about lists and their evaluation.
The spine is the (conceptual) connective structure that holds the elements of the collection together.

The list `[1, 2, 3]` is actually `1 : (2 : (3 : []))`, which we can visualize like this:

**IMPORTANT**: The `1 : 2 : [3]` representation makes it look like 1 exists before the cons cell that contains it, but it is the cons cell that contains values (not values coming before, and containing, the cons cells).

Because of non-strict evaluation, it is possible to evaluate the cons cells without having to evaluate the values the cons cells contain.

TODO: Is the cons cell the same as the spine?

It is also possible to evaluate only part of a list.

- Evaluation of the list proceeds *down* the spine.
- Constructing the list proceeds *up* the spine.

For `1 : (2 : [])`, start with the infix `:` and evaluate 1 on the left and the cons cell on the right.
Then evaluate the next `:` for the 2 and the empty list.

Construct the list `[1, 2]`:

* `1 : (2 : [])`
* First, cons 2 to the empty list (put 2 in front of the empty list).
* Then cons 1 to the existing, already existing list `2 : []` (put 1 in front of 2).

Haskell is non-strict.
When we “have a list”, we have a *blueprint for a list*, not the list itself.
It will be constructed only when something needs its values, and it will only construct the needed values.

```
ghci> take 3 [1 ..]
[1,2,3]
```

Even though `[1 ..]` can potentially build an infinite list, because of `take 3`, only three elements are actually constructed.

With lists, the spine is a linear succession of a cons cell wrapping another cons cell.
With trees and some other data structures, the spines can be nodes containing other nodes.

== Checking Evaluation with :sprint

Docs for link:https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html#ghci-cmd-:print[GHCi :print^] and link:https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html#ghci-cmd-:sprint[GHCi :sprint^].

GHC introduces some opportunistic optimizations to make code faster when it knows it won’t change how it (the code) evaluates.
Also remember that something like `Num a => a` means `a` is not a concrete type yet (it is waiting for a concrete type to be fully realized.)

The output “_” means *unevaluated*.

[source,ghci]
----
λ> xs = [1 .. 5] :: [Int]
λ> :sprint xs
xs = _
[source,ghci]
----

In this case, the `xs = _` means `xs` is completely unevaluated.
But if we take one value from `xs`, then one element has been evaluated, but not the rest:

[source,ghci]
----
λ> take 1 xs
1
:sprint xs
xs = 1 : _
take 2 xs
[1, 2]
:sprint xs
xs = 1 : 2 : _
----

BEWARE: We need a concrete type for `:sprint` to show how much has been evaluated.
See link:https://discord.com/channels/280033776820813825/505367988166197268/1115246246093922334[this Discord question].

The `length` function is only strict on the spine (it doesn't need to evaluate the values).
It seems at some versions of GHC would force evaluation of the values too, though.

[source,ghci]
----
λ xs = [1 .. 5] :: [Int]
λ :sprint xs
xs = _
λ take 2 xs
[1,2]
λ :sprint xs
xs = 1 : 2 : _
λ length xs
5
λ :sprint xs
xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
----

`xs` is not a list in memory in which we can see the evaluation proceed until you specify a type.
For instance, we can say:

[source,ghci]
----
λ> xs = [1 .. 5]
λ> take 2 (xs :: [Int])
[1,2]
λ> take 3 (xs :: [Double])
[1.0,2.0,3.0]
----

`xs` can't be a list of both these types at once.

== Evaluations of Spines and Values

“Normal Form” (NF) means an expression is fully evaluated.
By default, all expressions are in WKNF (_Weak Head Normal Form_), which means expressions are only evaluated as far as necessary.

If an expression is WHNF, it means it could be fully evaluated, or it was evaluated up to the point of reaching a data constructor or a lambda awaiting an argument.

Some expression in WHNF can be further evaluated if another argument is provided.
If no further arguments are possible, we say it is in WHNF but also NF.

By definition, anything in NF is also in WHNF.

WH is an expression evaluated at least up to the first data constructor.

The expression `(8, 9)` is in WHNF and NF.
The expression is indeed evaluated to _at least_ the first data constructor.
It is also NF because it is fully evaluated.

The expression `(8, 8 + 1)` is in WHNF, but not in NF because the expression `8 + 1` has not been evaluated yet.

[source,ghci]
----
λ t = (8 :: Int, 9 :: Int)
λ :sprint t
t = (8,9)

λ u = (8 :: Int, (8 + 1) :: Int)
λ :sprint u
u = (8,_)
----

The expression `\n -> n + 1` (a lambda anonymous expression) is in WHNF and NF.
The operator `+` has been applied to `n` and `1`, but the the expression cannot be further reduced until `\n ->` is applied.

But something like `"TR" ++ "1996"` is neither in WHNF nor NF.
The `++` function has fully applied arguments, but the whole expression has not been evaluated yet.

== length and evaluation

Note we have a _bottom_ value (`undefined`) as the second element in the lists below:

[source,ghci]
----
λ length [1, undefined, 3]
3

λ map (+ 1) [1, undefined, 3]
[2,*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:75:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at <interactive>:19:15 in interactive:Ghci2
----

The `length` expression works but the `map` one does not. Why‽

Because `length` is only strict on the spine.
It only counts how many cons cells there are without even trying to evaluate the values.

The `map (+ 1)` on the other hand, requires that the values are evaluated so `(+ 1)` can be applied to them.

Note, however, that `:sprint` thinks the list was fully evaluated in some situations:

[source,ghci]
----
λ xs :: [Int]; xs = [1, 2, 3]
λ length xs
3
λ :sprint xs
xs = [_,_,_]

λ ys = [1, 2, 3] :: [Int]
λ length ys
3
length = _
λ :sprint ys
ys = [1,2,3]

λ zs = [1, 2, 3]
λ length zs
3
λ :sprint zs
zs = _
----

It shows `xs = [\_,_,_]` but `ys = [1,2,3]`.
And because `zs` is polymorphic (was not assigned a concrete type), it just shows `zs = _`.
