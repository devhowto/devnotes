== foldr and foldr implementation

We are naming them `fldr` and `fldl` so they don't conflict with standard `foldr` and `foldl`.

.fldr and fldr
[source,haskell]
----
fldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
fldr _ acc []       = acc
fldr f acc (x : xs) = f x (fldr f acc xs)

fldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
fldl _ acc []       = acc
fldl f acc (x : xs) = fldl f (f acc x) xs
