= Vim and CoC (Conquer of Completion)

== clangd

By default, `inlayHints` are enabled.

In vim:

----
:CocLocalConfig

{
  "suggest.autoTrigger": "none",
  "clangd.disableDiagnostics": false,
  "inlayHint.enable": false
}
----

There is a setting like his in VSCode too.
And and it has an option to enable it only when holding `ctrl+alt`, which is awesome.
