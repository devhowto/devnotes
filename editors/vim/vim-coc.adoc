== AsciiDoc

[NOTE]
====
Gitlab has much superior support for Asciidoc (through the Asciidoctor implementation), including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) notation (see link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/asciidoc.html#equations-and-formulas-stem[Gitlab Docs on Asciidoc STEM]).

It also supports PlantUML, which is a truly amazing _Diagrams as Code_ tool).

A matrix can be written as stem:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].

== clangd

By default, `inlayHints` are enabled.

In vim:

----
:CocLocalConfig

{
  "suggest.autoTrigger": "none",
  "clangd.disableDiagnostics": false,
  "inlayHint.enable": false
}
----

There is a setting for this in VSCode too.
And and it has an option to enable it only when holding `ctrl+alt`, which is awesome.
