== Page Break

`0x0c` is the _page break_ character.

Those page break markers display something like "^L" in both vim and emacs.

=== Emacs

In emacs, we can insert them with kbd:[C-q C-l] and navigate between them with kbd:[C-x [] and kbd:[C-x ].

From emacs, kbd:[C-h i m Emacs RET] kbd:[m Pages RET].

=== Vim

In vim, the digraph is `FF`, or with which means we can insert them with kbd:[CTRL-K FF]
Or, insert the char with kbd:[CTRL-V CTRL-L]
Then one can search for those page breaks with something like kbd:[/CTRL-V CTRL-L] or kbd:[?CTRL-V CTRL-L] followed by kbd:[n] or kbd:[N] to search forwards and backwards.

[TIP]
====
If kbd:[CTRL-V] is mapped to some other thing (e.g. paste text), kbd:[CTRL-Q] can also be used.
====

One example where I used this is for my The Little Schemer solutions, where code for each chapter is preceded by a page break character so I can easily navigate between the chapters.

See:

.in vim help
----
:help insert.txt
:help i_CTRL-V
:help i_CTRL-Q
----

If we don't want kbd:[C-s] to lock and terminal (which is unlocked with kbd:[C-q]):

.bashrc
----
stty -ixon

== Insert Special Characters

* link:https://twitter.com/ed1conf/status/1697720405442584581[Insert Special Chars :: ed(1) Conference on Twitter]

[source,shell-session]
----
$ setxkbmap -option compose:caps
----

Then type kbd:[CapsLock] followed by:

* kbd:[.=] → •
* kbd:[<>] → ⋄
* kbd:[L-] → £
* kbd:[E=] → €
* kbd:[--.] → en-dash
* kbd:[---] → em-dash

In vim/nvim, we can set digraphs like these (besides the ones that come pre-configured by default):

[source,vim]
----
$ 0< ~/work/src/dotfiles/digraphs.vim sed ''
""
" Some extra digraphs I use frequently.
"

""
" • Bullet.
"
" Insert a bullet to make lists in plain plain text files and code
" comments. I am crazy about well-written, well-formatted textual
" content. Example:
"
" Some of my favorite games:
" • Super Mario World ---------: 1990;
" • Tomb Raider ---------------: 1996;
" • Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K. 2 ---: 2000;
" • Hitman Codename 47 --------: 2000;
" • Aliens versus Predator 2 --: 2001;
" ... many others...
"
digraphs oo 8226 " •

""
" ◦ White Bullet.
"
digraphs OO 9702

""
" · Middle Dot.
"
digraphs oO 183

""
" ‽ Interrobang.
"
digraphs ?! 8253
----

So if one types kbd:[Ctrl+k] followed by the char sequence, the special unicode character is inserted instead.

On VSCode, in the user `settings.json`, because I use the vim extensions, I have something like this which also works with kbd:[Ctrl+k] followed by char sequence:

[source,json]
----
{
  "vim.digraphs": {
    "oo": ["•", "0x2022"], // Bullet.
    "OO": ["◦", "0x25e6"], // White bullet.
    "oO": ["·", "0x00b7"], // Middle dot.
    "m-": ["—", "0x2014"], // Em dash.
    "?!": ["‽", "0x203d"], // Interrobang.
  },
}
