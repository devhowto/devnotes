== Install Python

Looks like we can install specific versions of python.
For example, `brew install python` was installing python 3.11 as of Nov 17th, 2023.
I needed 3.9.6, and this command installed the version I needed:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ brew install python3@3.9.6
----

On a coworker's machine, `python3 --version` would show some errors and fail.
Running `xcode-select --install` fixed the problem.
