== Keyboard Shortcuts

Show hidden files: kbd:[Cmd+Shift+.].
The kbd:[.] makes sense as in unix parlance hidden files are also known as _dot files_.
I even have my own link:https://gitlab.com/fernandobasso/dotfiles[dotfiles^] repository to store my personal system configuration.

kbd:[Cmd+m] minimizes a window and then kbd:[Cmd+Tab] does not open it.
But if you hide (instead of minimize) with kbd:[Cmd+h] then you can bring it back with kbd:[Cmd+Tab].

kbd:[Cmd+Opt+h] hides all other windows except the one currently in focus.

kbd:[Cmd+w] closes one instance of a program or tab of a window.
kbd:[Cmd+q] closes all the application instances.

kbd:[Cmd+Spc] opens Spotlight.
Navigate item by item with up/down and by section (submenus) with kbd:[Cmd+Up] :kbd:[Cmd+Down].
Left-click or press kbd:[Enter] to preview.
kbd:[Cmd+r] opens in Finder.
