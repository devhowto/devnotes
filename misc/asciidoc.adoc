== Markdown to Asciidoc

Use kramdown, which is better suited than pandoc as it has more AsciiDoc-sensible options.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ gem install kramdown kramdown-asciidoc

$ for file in ./*.md ; do
    kramdoc \
      --format=GFM \
      --output="${file%.md}.adoc" \
      --wrap=ventilate "$file"
  done

== Source Highlighter

Add this attribute to the document:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: <which highlighter to use>
----

As of 2023, the docs currently say for pygments we simply write `pygments`.

image::asciidoctor-source-highlighter-pygments.rb-2023-11-11T14-33-05-612Z.png[Asciidoctor Source Highlighter pygments.rb]

but I got an error with this:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: pygments
----

[source,shell-session]
----
$ asciidoctor ./algds/other/prime_factors/README.adoc
asciidoctor: WARNING: optional gem 'pygments.rb' is not available (reason: cannot load 'pygments'). Functionality disabled.

But if I changing to `pygments.rb` works:

=== Source Highlighter Not Working

We have observed at times that if `asciidoctor` is installed from a `Gemfile` and `pygments.rb` is installed with `gem install`, it may fail (with no errors) to add the tags around the code tokens.

Installing everything from `Gemfile` and then running `bundle exec asciidoctor file.adoc` worked.
