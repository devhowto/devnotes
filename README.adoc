[NOTE]
====
Gitlab has much superior support for Asciidoc (through the Asciidoctor implementation), including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) notation (see link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/asciidoc.html#equations-and-formulas-stem[Gitlab Docs on Asciidoc]).

It also supports PlantUML, which is a truly amazing _Diagrams as Code_ tool).

A matrix can be written as stem:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].
