[NOTE]
====
Gitlab has much superior support for Asciidoc (through the Asciidoctor implementation), including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) notation (see link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/asciidoc.html#equations-and-formulas-stem[Gitlab Docs on Asciidoc STEM]).

It also supports PlantUML, which is a truly amazing _Diagrams as Code_ tool).

== Document titles and subtitles

We use the notion of title and subtitle as two separate pieces of information mostly because the title is used on the sidebar and top of the page, while the combination of both are used to compose the full document title in rendered HTML.

The document titles should include the main title plus some extra information that further categorizes the content of that page.
And then immediately after the title, create a `page-subtitle` custom attribute to set further title information which will be used by our tooling to compose the full title.

[source,text]
----
= Title
:page-subtitle: My Subtitle
----

The rendered HTML would contain something like this:

[source,html]
----
<title>Title » My Subtitle</title>
----

Guidelines:

* If writing about function composition in Haskell, make “Function Composition” the main title, and then “Haskell” as the subtitle.
* Create some snippets on your editor to help you maintain some consistency.
* Think and compare with existing titles and subtitles.
Don't just do whatever comes to mind.

Let us see some examples.

[TIP]
====
Think about how the final title will look like to help you come up with good titles and subtitles.
