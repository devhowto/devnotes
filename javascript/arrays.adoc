== Array of n elements

[source,javascript]
----
Array(5).fill(0);
----

The above makes a sparse array, and sparse arrays are permanently slow.

Using `Array()` has always been considered a bad practice and engines never bothered to optimizing it as they would have to check the prototype chain.

This is the more recommended way of creating an array of stem:[n] elements:

[source,javascript]
----
Array.from({ length: 5 }) => (_, i) => i;
----
