Whenever the debounced function is called within the given time window, the timer is reset.
Only after the elapsed period of inactivity exceeds the debounce time will the debounced function be called.

== Meaning of debounce in this context

The term _debounce_ originates from electronics.
When a switch is pressed, it generates multiple ripples of current/contact which causes the device to inadvertently activate multiple times.
This phenomenon is dubbed _bouncing_.
Thus, debouncing is some technique to prevent this unwanted behavior.

Regarding software, the debouncing idea was borrowed to _debounce_ events, signals, etc.

 * @param {number} t The number of milliseconds for the time window.
 * @returns {Function}
 */
function debounce(fn, t) {
  let timeoutId;

  return function debounced(...args) {
    if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    timeoutId = setTimeout(function debounced () {
      fn(...args);
    }, t);
  };
}
