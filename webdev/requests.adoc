== Request Timeout

[quote, attribution, cite title]
____
In browsers, `fetch()`` usually times out after a set period of time which varies amongst browsers.
For example, in Firefox this timeout is set to 90 seconds by default, but in Chromium, it is 300 seconds.
In Node.js, no default timeout is set for `fetch()` requests, but the newly added `AbortSignal.timeout()` API provides an easy way to cancel a `fetch()` request when a timeout is reached.
