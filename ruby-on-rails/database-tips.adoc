== Starting DB from scratch

Sometimes during development one may want (or need) to start from a clean slate.

[NOTE]
====
It may be necessary to make sure the database has no active connections or the following commands may fail.

Check if `rails server` is running, or if you are logged into `db:console`, `psql` or `mysql` CLIs or some of their UI clients, etc.
====

=== db:reset

This loads database information from `schema.rb`.
It DOES NOT run migrations.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ rails db:reset
----

The above is equivalent to:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ rails db:drop db:setup
----

=== drop, create, migrate

Alternatively, we may want to start fresh but running the migrations (instead of loading from `schema.rb`):

[source,shell-session]
----
$ rails db:drop db:crete db:migrate db:seed
