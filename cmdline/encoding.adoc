== vim ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 problem

Convert a ISO-8859-1 file to UTF-8, some chars that looked like tabulations becomes these `<88>` things.

.0x0088 Character Tabulation Set
----
Âˆ
----

The char above may show up as "^" or "<88>", depending on the editor or some other rendering factors, like having or missing proper fonts or OS support/config for it.

Can substitute those for normal tabs (or whatever other char) with:

----
:s/[\x88]/TAB/
----

Note the character class.
If we simply do `s/\x88/` it will look for each individual char `\`, `x`, `8` and `8`, and not the code point they represent when combined together.
