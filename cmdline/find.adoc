== Find files and store in array

Find files whose extension is `.md` and store them in a bash array:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ mapfile -d $'\0' mds < <(find . -iname '*.md' -print0)
----

We make use of the `mapfile` shell builtin with the shell-quoting `$''`
syntax to specify NUL byte as delimiter (produced by `-print0`),
redirection and process substitution `<(...)`.
