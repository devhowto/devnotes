== Print Lines From a File

Print entire file:

----
$ cat file.txt # <1>
$ sed '' file.tx # <2>
$ sed -n p file.txt # <3>
$ sed -n '1,$ p' file.txt # <3>
----

1. Yeah, we could use `cat`.

2. Or use an empty command, which by default (without `-n`) just outputs the content of the pattern space.

3. Or using `-n` to avoid auto-printing of the pattern space and explicitly using `p` command to print, which prints all the lines if no address is used.

4. Doing everything explicitly.
