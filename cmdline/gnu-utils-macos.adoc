== Install newer bash on MacOS

[source,shell-session]
----
$ brew install bash
$ which -a bash
/usr/local/bin/bash
/bin/bash
----

Append this line to `/etc/shells`:

./etc/shells
----
...
/usr/local/bin/bash
----

Change default shell to new installed bash, for your user and the root user:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
$ sudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
----

At this point, we have:

* `/bin/bash`
* `/usr/local/bin/bash`

That is, the old bash is still there.
If you start shell scripts with this shebang line, you'll be using the old bash:

.old bash shebang
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

echo "$BASH_VERSION"
----

But don't use the shebang of `#!/usr/local/bin/bash`, as this would fail on other unix machines (Linux, BSD, etc.)
Instead, use this:

.recommended shebang
[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
----
