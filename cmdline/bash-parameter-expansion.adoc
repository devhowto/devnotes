== Use contents of file as part of string

Imagine this commit:

----
$ git commit -m 'Update .nvmrc with version ???'
----

Damn it! Forgot the version.
Maybe I open another shell and `cat` the contents of the file, or stop this command line to do that in “this” shell session?

Or maybe we learn to use the features of the tools at our disposal‽

Test like this:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ echo "Test: $(sed '' .nvmrc') end"
Test: v18.12.1 end
----

Added “end” just to see if the result would be on a single line.
It is!
We are ready to commit our changes.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ git commit -m "Update .nvmrc with node $(sed '' .nvmrc)"
----

The result will be something like:

----
$ git add .nvmrc

$ git commit -m "Update .nvmrc with node $(sed '' .nvmrc)"

    Update .nvmrc with node v18.12.1
----

== remove newline

Similar to `tr -d '\n`, we can also do in pure bash:

[source,bash]
----
"${var//[$'\t\r\n']}"
----
