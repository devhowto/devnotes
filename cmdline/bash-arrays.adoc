== Serialize and Store Bash Array to a File

Let's save the array `nums` below as NUL-separated values in `nums.dat`

[source,bash]
----
$ nums=(1 2 3 4)
$ printf '%s\0' "${nums[@]}" 1> nums.dat
----

If you `less nums-arr.dat` or open it in vim or emacs, it'll show up something like this:

[source,text]
----
1^@2^@3^@4^@
----

The numbers are the numbers we stored (duh ü§£), and the "^@" is not a caret followed by an at sign, but a visual representation of the NUL byte.
When some tools want to display them, they (the tools) have to use something visible and the convention is to use "^@", which many tools do.
Not all tools will display something visually in place of those chars (or at least, not by default), though.

We can also inspect the file with `od`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ od -cax nums.dat
0000000   1  \0   2  \0   3  \0   4  \0
          1 nul   2 nul   3 nul   4 nul
           0031    0032    0033    0034
----

Anyway, we serialized our array and stored it in a file.

== Deserialize Bash Array From a File

How to deserialize the contents of `nums.dat` and turn it back into code‚ÄΩ
By using `mapfile`.

=== Using mapfile

To deserialize the data and turn it back into code -- an array -- we use `mapfile`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ IFS= mapfile -d '' xs < nums.dat
$ printf '%d\n' "${xs[@]}"
1
2
3
4
----

=== Why can't we use read‚ÄΩ

Try `read` instead of `mapfile` and it doesn't work:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ IFS= read -ra nums < nums.txt

$ printf '%d\n' "${nums[@]}"
1234

$ IFS=\\0 read -ra nums < nums.txt

$ printf '%d\n' "${nums[@]}"
1234
----

It seems even using `IFS=\\0` or `IFS='\0'` doesn't work. Let's use this to learn more about both `read` and `mapfile`, shall we‚ÄΩ

[NOTE]
====
`readarray` is an alias to `mapfile`
====

=== Understanding mapfile vs read

So, why does `read -a -d ''` does not work, while `mapfile -d ''` does‚ÄΩ

First let's see what `read` and `mapfile` are supposed to do.

`help read` says:

.help read
____
"Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields."

Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied.
The line is split into fields as with word splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to the last NAME.
Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word delimiters."
____

And `help mapfile` says:

.help mapfile
____
"Read lines from the standard input into an indexed array variable.

Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array variable ARRAY, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied.
The variable MAPFILE is the default ARRAY."

-- help mapfile
____

The important bits for our case is that `read` *reads a single line*, and `mapfile` reads *reads lines*. Note the plural on ‚Äúlines‚Äù. A very important detail here.

Now let's scrutinize the `-d` option of both commands.

.help read
[source,text]
----
-d delim  continue until the first character of DELIM is
read, rather than newline
----

.help mapfile
[source,text]
----
-d delim  Use DELIM to terminate lines, instead of newline
----

OK, so `-d` does the same thing for both commands.
They use the delimiter in `-d DELIM` to indicate what character should be used to
indicate line termination, rather than `\n`.

That means `read -d ''` will read the first value of our NUL-separated input and consider it _a line_ of input, and be done with it (after all, `read` ‚Äúreads a single line of input‚Äù).

`mapfile` will also read the first value of our NUL-separated input and consider it _a line_ of input, but rather than be done with it at this point, it will continue reading more lines (after all, `mapfile` ‚Äúreads multiple lines of input‚Äù).

=== IFS= and \0 (NUL)

One thing to consider is that variables cannot hold `NUL`.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ printf a\\0b | od -A n -tac
a nul   b
a  \0   b
----

It wouldn't be particularly useful if variables could store `NUL` since the point of a variable is usually to be used in the environment or as an argument to a command, where NULs are not accepted either.

`printf` interprets `\0` but `IFS=\\0` is something different.

The link:https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_05_03[spec] says: ‚ÄúVariables shall be initialized from the environment‚Äù.

And we can't have NUL in the environment.

[NOTE]
====
This topic is hard and has tormented me for a long time üòÖ.
====

About "variables cannot hold NUL", section 2.5 Parameter and Variables (link:https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_05_03[spec]) states that:

> A parameter is set if it has an assigned value (null is a valid value)."

And

> A variable is a parameter denoted by name.

They mean empty string to be null there.
Some people and docs also use null string.

[NOTE]
====
It seems empty string, null string, and null are sometimes used interchangeably to mean the same idea of absence of a value.
====

Some on #bash IRC think ‚Äúthey should just write ‚Äúempty string‚Äù but...‚Äù

Some also say that ‚Äúa variable set to an empty string is indistinguishable from a variable set to null.‚Äù

That may not be 100% correct:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ unset x y; declare x= y; set -u; echo $x $y
bash: y: unbound variable

$ [ -z $x ] && echo 'x is NUL'
x is NUL

$ [ -z $y ] && echo 'y is NUL'
bash: y: unbound variable

$ set +u; [ -z $y ] && echo 'y is NUL'
y is NUL
----

Perhaps it is more precise to say _almost indistinguishable_ because some special circumstances and shell settings are also into play.

=== field separator vs terminator

We also have to be clear on the fact that *field separator* is different than *terminator*.
A _terminator_ could indicate the end of input, end of a line, etc.
An input could be separated into multiple fields, and each field could be an entire line, so multiple lines would mean multiple fields.

Some people on #bash IRC claim that it makes more sense to use `\n` as field separator and `\0` (NUL) as terminators rather than the other way around.

== Serialize a NUL-separated list of files to a variable

[source,shell-session]
----
$ mapfile -td '' files < <(find ... -print0)
$ printf %s\\0 "${files[@]}"
----
