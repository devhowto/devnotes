== insert into empty file

sed operates on lines.
If a file contains no lines, sed cannot insert a line into the file.

That means if we create a really empty file and try to insert some content into like 1, it won't work and no lines are inserted:

.sed insert into no-lines file
[source,shell-session]
----
$ : > ./file.txt

$ du ./file.txt
0    ./file.txt

$ sed -f - ./file.txt <<EOF > ./new.txt
1 i\\
foo\\
bar\\
EOF

$ du  ./new.txt
0	    ./new.txt
----

As we see, `new.txt` is empty.

One approach would be to create a one-empty-line file instead:

.single empty line file
[source,shell-session]
----
$ printf '\n' > ./file.txt

$ sed -f - ./file.txt <<EOF > ./new.txt
1 i\\
foo\\
bar\\
EOF

$ cat ./new.txt
foo
bar
