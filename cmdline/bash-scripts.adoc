== Run Script from STDIN

=== Introductory Example

You have this script:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ cat ./script.sh
printf '%s\n' "$1"
----

Note it takes one parameter which is passed to printf.
It can be called like this:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ bash ./script.sh hello
hello
----

But there are situations which require the script to be run from STDIN.
Then, to pass the parameter, these are possible:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ cat ./script.sh | bash -s - hello
hello

$ bash -s - hello < <(cat ./script.sh)
hello
----

=== GPG-Encrypted Script

For example, it may be necessary to run a script from STDIN when we want to decrypt and run it “on the fly”, without first saving it to a plain, unencrypted file:

First, say we encrypt our script with `gpg`:

[source,shell-session]
----
gpg \
  --no-symkey-cache \
  --symmetric \
  --output ./script.sh.gpg \
  ./script.sh
----

And then, we need to run it from the encrypted file.
Again, both of these approaches work:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ bash -s - 'It works!' < <(gpg -dq ./script.sh.gpg)
It works!

$ gpg -dq ./script.sh.gpg | bash -s - 'Once again!'
Once again!
----

[NOTE]
====
Depending on how GnuPG and/or `gpg-agent` is set up on your computer, you may or may not be prompted for passwords at any given time.
====

[TIP]
====
It may be necessary to prevent errors or warning messages to be sent to STDOUT, which would make the script text invalid.
Maybe, something like this:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ 2> /dev/null gpg -dq ./script.sh.gpg | bash -s - 'Once again!'
Once again!
----
====

== Other Cases

This is also quite useful over ssh.
Send your script to remote, read back its output

[source,shell-session]
----
gpg -dq ./script.gpg 2>/dev/null | bash -s -- <args...>
---
