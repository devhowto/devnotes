== Install on Arch Linux

[TIP]
====
Part of these notes is based on this .txt:

Chicken Scheme provides some commands like `csc` (Chicken Scheme Compiler) and `csi` (chicken Scheme Interpreter), and few others.
In some distros, including Arch Linux, those program names were later replaced with the .NET Mono stuff:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ pkgfile --search csc
extra/calc
extra/mono

$ pkgfile --search csi
extra/mono
----

Which means if we have .NET Mono installed and try to type `csi` or `csc`, we'll be invoking Mono tools rather than Chicken Scheme tools.

If we don't have .NET Mono packages installed, we can simply install Chicken Scheme from the official Arch Linux repositories:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ sudo pacman --sync --refresh --needed chicken
----

But if we have .NET Mono installed (I had once because it was a dependency of some other package), then we can build and install Chicken Scheme manually and add it to the path in a way that takes precedence over Mono `csi` and `csc`.


[source,shell-session]
----
$ mkdir -pv ~/local/build
$ cd !$

$ wget http://code.call-cc.org/releases/5.3.0/chicken-5.3.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf chicken-5.3.0.tar.gz
$ cd chicken-5.3.0

$ make PREFIX=$HOME/local/chicken-5.3.0 -j$(nproc)
$ make PREFIX=$HOME/local/chicken-5.3.0 install

$ export PATH="$HOME/local/chicken-5.3.0/bin:$PATH"
----

Note we add the local chicken bin path first when exporting.
That'll make sure that path is searched for first.

After the `make & make install` commands above, we should have the necessary tools available in `~/local/chicken-5.3.0` and its subdirectories:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ tree -C ~/local/chicken-5.3.0/bin
/home/deveng/local/chicken-5.3.0/bin
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken-do
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken-install
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken-profile
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken-status
â”œâ”€â”€ chicken-uninstall
â”œâ”€â”€ csc
â”œâ”€â”€ csi
â””â”€â”€ feathers
----

Then let's try a few commands to see things are working:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ which csi
/home/deveng/local/chicken-5.3.0/bin/csi

$ which csc
/home/deveng/local/chicken-5.3.0/bin/csc

$ csc -help | head -n 4
Usage: csc [OPTION ...] [FILENAME ...]

  `csc' is a driver program for the CHICKEN compiler. Files given on the
  command line are translated, compiled or linked as needed.

$ csi

Congrats! We are all set up and ready to code! ðŸŽ‰
