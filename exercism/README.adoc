== Notes on multiple solutions

I like to try multiple solutions and multiple approaches when solving a particular problem.
For this reason, I like to name my solution files with suffixes like _v1 and _v2, etc.

When submitting solutions, one must edit `.exercism/config.json` and correctly set the `files.solution` property to point to the latest solution we want to submit.

== Scheme

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress.

Exercism Scheme challenges are supposed to work with Chez or Guile.
To make them work with Chicken Scheme, a few changes are necessary:

* Replace `(import (rnrs)) ...` `(import (scheme))...`.

== Titles, Subtitles and Links

Exercism has two basic types of exercises:

* Learning exercises (which don't provide or refer to a difficulty level).
* Challenges, which can be of difficulty level _easy_, _medium_ or _hard_.

The page title should contain the main exercise or challenge type.
The `page-subtitle` attribute shall be of the form “Exercism [Easy|Medium|Hard] <type> :: <language>”.
Note that the difficulty level is used only if the type is challenge.

The link for the learning or exercise should be a single list element of the form:

[source,text]
----
* link:<URL>[<name> Exercism [easy|medium|hard] <language> <challenge | learning exercise>.
----

Example for a learning exercise:

[source,text]
----
= Amusement Park
:page-subtitle: Exercism Learning Exercise :: Ruby

* link:<url>[Amusement Park Exercism Ruby learning exercise].
----

Example for a challenge:

[source,text]
----
= Meetup
:page-subtitle: Exercism Easy Challenge :: Ruby

* link:<url>[Meetup Exercism easy Ruby challenge].
----

These command line oneliners can help us see the links that follow the pattern described above:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ grep --color -r '\* link.*' | sed 's/^[^[]\+//g'

[Amusement Park Improvements Ruby learning exercise^].
[Microwave Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Lasagna Exercism Ruby learning exercise^].
[Amusement Park Exercism Ruby learning exercise^].
[Meetup Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Acronym Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Resistor Color Duo Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].

$ grep --color -r '\* link.*' | sed 's/^[^[]\+//g' | grep 'Exercism.*learning'

[Amusement Park Improvements Exercism Ruby learning exercise^].
[Lasagna Exercism Ruby learning exercise^].
[Amusement Park Exercism Ruby learning exercise^].

$ grep --color -r '\* link.*' \
    | sed 's/^[^[]\+//g' \
    | grep 'Exercism \(easy\|medium\|hard\).*challenge'

[Microwave Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Meetup Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Acronym Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
[Resistor Color Duo Exercism easy Ruby challenge^].
