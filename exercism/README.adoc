== Notes on multiple solutions

I like to try multiple solutions and multiple approaches when solving a particular problem.
For this reason, I like to name my solution files with suffixes like _v1 and _v2, etc.

When submitting solutions, one must edit `.exercism/config.json` and correctly set the `files.solution` property to point to the latest solution we want to submit.

== Scheme

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress.

Exercism Scheme challenges are supposed to work with Chez or Guile.
To make them work with Chicken Scheme, a few changes are necessary:

* Replace `(import (rnrs)) ...` `(import (scheme))...`.
