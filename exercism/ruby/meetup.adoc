If the day of week targeted is after the start day of the schedule then I just use it.
So if my schedule starts with Tuesday (2) and I want a Wednesday (3) I just need to add one day (3 - 1).
But if my schedule starts on Friday (5) and I want a Monday (1) I would need to
go back 4 days (5 - 1) but then I would end up before my start day, so
I just add a full week (7) to get the next Monday.

<1> If the day of week we target is stem:[\ge] the start day of our schedule then I just use it.
So if the schedule starts with Tuesday (2) and we want a Wednesday (3) I just need to add one day stem:[3 - 1].

But if our schedule starts on Friday (5) and we want a Monday (1), we would need to go back 4 days stem:[5 - 1], but then we would end up before our start day, so we just add a full week (7) to get the next Monday.
