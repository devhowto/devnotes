== Ruby

=== Solution 1

This solution involves some string surgery.
It works but there is probably a more mathy and elegant (and probably shorter) approach we can try.

[source,ruby]
----
Microwave = Class.new do
  def initialize(seconds)
    @seconds = seconds
  end

  ##
  # Convert an input in seconds to a timer display hh:mm.
  #
  # @return [String]
  #
  def timer
    secs = @seconds.to_s

    if secs.size <= 2
      hours, seconds = @seconds.divmod(60)
      return pad(hours) << ':' << pad(seconds)
    else
      overflow_hours, remaining_seconds = seconds(secs).divmod(60)
      pad(hours(secs) + overflow_hours) << ':' << pad(remaining_seconds)
    end
  end

  private

  ##
  # Get the seconds of a three-or-more-digit string.
  #
  # @param secs [String]
  # @return [Integer]
  #
  def seconds(secs)
    #
    # This range returns the last two digits of the digit string,
    # which are the seconds. For example, in '257', 2 is the hour,
    # and 57 is the seconds.
    #
    secs[-2 .. -1].to_i
  end

  ##
  # Get the hours from a three-or-more-digit string.
  #
  def hours(secs)
    hours_len = secs.size - 2

    ##
    # If we have seconds like '257', and 57 is the seconds, then we
    # have a range from 0...1, which returns 2. Since 257 has three
    # digits, 3 - 2 is 1, which we use in the range.
    #
    # If we have seconds like '1001', then the seconds is 01 and the
    # hours is the range from 0...2, which will return 10. Since
    # 1001 has four digits, 4 - 2 is 2, which we use in the range.
    #
    secs[0...hours_len].to_i
  end

  ##
  # Pad n with 0 to make sure it is always a two digit string.
  #
  # Simply return the number as string if no padding needed.
  #
  # @param n [Integer]
  # @return [String]
  #
  def pad(n)
    s = n.to_s

    s.size < 2 ? '0' << s : s
  end
end

=== Solution 2

The first solution used modular division for the seconds, but the idea can be extended so it also satisfy cases where the input is something like 272.

`272.divmod(10)` results in `2, 72`.

So we have 2 hours and 72 seconds.
We can then get those 72 seconds and do modular division in base 60.
`72.divmod(60)` results in `1, 12`, which means 72 seconds is actually 1 hour and 12 seconds.

We then simply add the 2 hours from the first modular division by 100 to the 1 hour we got from the modular division by 60.
It in the end, it gives us 3 hours and 12 seconds.

The same approach works with other inputs like 7, 93, 272, or 1001.
Let's see some IRB session examples.

.example with input 7
[source,irb]
----
>> tmp_hours, tmp_seconds = 7.divmod(100)
=> [0, 7]

#                                           7
>> overflow_hours, remaining_seconds = tmp_seconds.divmod(60)
=> [0, 7]

#                      0            0                 7
>> '%02d:%02d' % [tmp_hours + overflow_hours, remaining_seconds]
=> "00:07"
----

Both `tmp_hours` and `overflow_hours` are 0, and 0 + 0 is still 0.
The remaining seconds is still 7, and the resulting string is "00:07", which is 100% the expected result!

.example with input 93
[source,irb]
----
>> tmp_hours, tmp_seconds = 93.divmod(100)
=> [0, 93]

#                                           93
>> overflow_hours, remaining_seconds = tmp_seconds.divmod(60)
=> [1, 33]

#                    0      +       1       ,        33
>> '%02d:%02d' % [tmp_hours + overflow_hours, remaining_seconds]
=> "01:33"
----

.example with input 272
[source,irb]
----
>> tmp_hours, tmp_seconds = 272.divmod(100)
=> [2, 72]

#                                           72
>> overflow_hours, remaining_seconds = tmp_seconds.divmod(60)
=> [1, 12]

#                     2     +        1      ,       12
>> '%02d:%02d' % [tmp_hours + overflow_hours, remaining_seconds]
=> "03:12"
----

.example with input 1001
[source,irb]
----
>> tmp_hours, tmp_seconds = 1001.divmod(100)
=> [10, 1]

#                                            1
>> overflow_hours, remaining_seconds = tmp_seconds.divmod(60)
=> [0, 1]

#                     10    +         0     ,        1
>> '%02d:%02d' % [tmp_hours + overflow_hours, remaining_seconds]
=> "10:01"
