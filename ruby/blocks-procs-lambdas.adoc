== to_proc

The ampersand converts a block into a proc.

Resistor Color Duo on Exercism:

[source,text]
----
>> h = { one: 1, two: 2 }

>> [:one, :two].map(&h)
=> [1, 2]

>> h.fetch_values(:one, :two)
=> [1, 2]
----

The `&` operator calls `#to_proc` on the object.

[source,ruby]
----
class TwoTimer
  def to_proc = proc { |x| x * 2 }
end

p [1, 2, 3].map(&TwoTimer.new)
#=> [2, 4, 6]
----

[source,ruby]
----
class Hash
  def to_proc = proc { |k| p 'called'; self[k] }
end

h = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}

p [:a, :c].map(&h)
#=> "called"
#=> "called"
#=> [1, 3]
----

We can think of it not in terms of behavior, but as it being transformed into something else.

Procs are closures so they capture state.
In the above, that is the `self` which happens to be a hash object.

# Monkey-patch `Hash` with our own `#to_proc` implementation.

# NOTE: With `ruby -w` a warning is reported about overriding

class Hash

  # Causes each element to be incremented by one.
  #
  def to_proc = proc do |key|
    self[key] + 1
  end
end

h = { one: 1, two: 2 }

p [:one, :two].map(&h)
#=> [2, 3]
