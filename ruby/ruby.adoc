Ruby is a delightful programming language designed for programmer happiness 💖.

Yukihiro Matsumoto once presented link:./Yukihiro-Matsumoto-How-Emacs-Changed-My-Life.pdf[How Emacs Changed My Life (PDF)] which goes into how https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] and https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/[emacs-lisp] influenced Matz and the design of the Ruby programming language.
Unfortunately, it seems there is no video recording of it.

== Ruby Concepts and Ideas

* The name of the language is spelled _Ruby_ (not RUBY or ruby) because it is a proper noun (therefore, the first letter is capitalized). `ruby` is the name of the program we use to run Ruby programs, like `ruby -w fib.rb`.
* A _mix-in_ (also spelled _mix in_) is the including of a module inside a class. We say things like “The Enumerable mix-in module provides…”.
See https://ruby-doc.com/core/doc/syntax/modules_and_classes_rdoc.html[Ruby doc on modules].

== Bits and Bytes of Syntax Sugar

=== Hash Values

We can get all the values of a hash by doing this:

----
>> { one: 1, two: 2 }.map(&:last)
=> [1, 2]
----

Which is similar to doing `hash.values`.

=== Map and Hash to Proc to Get Values

----
>> h = { one: 1, two: 2 }

>> [:one, :two].map(&h)
=> [1, 2]
----

With an array of keys, we map over those keys, and _turn the hash into a proc_ 😲!
That proc will map the values based on the keys and return an array of the hash values.

Saw this first in a solution for https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/resistor-color-duo[resistor color duo exercism challenge].

If we define `to_proc` we can use this _trick_ for any object.

=== Hash Transform Values and &:next to_proc

----
>> {one: 1, two: 2}.transform_values(&:next)
=> {:one=>2, :two=>3}
----

## Note on Style

- link:https://discord.com/channels/518658712081268738/650031651845308419/1080189900311236719[My question on unnecessary readers on Discord].

No need to write readers for every instance variable if they don't need to be exposed publicly.
Just use the instance variables themselves.

## Methods

`1 + 1` is just syntax sugar for `1.+(1)`, that is, a normal method call.

Ruby doesn't have the post and pre increment operators `x--` or `++x`, although it has `#succ` and `#pred` which perform post increment and decrement for numbers and strings, but not something for pre increment and decrement.

If `1 + 1` is actually `1.+(1)`, one could ask what `n += 1` is syntax sugar for.
We know from other languages that `n += 1` is the same as `n = n + 1` (which works in Ruby too).

`+=` is not sugar, but just language syntax, not a method.
According to link:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Operators#Assignment[Ruby Operators :: Wikibooks^], these are called *self assignment*:

[source,text]
----
x = 1        #=> 1 (this is the only non-self assignment in this list)
x += x       #=> 2
x -= x       #=> 0
x += 4       #=> x was 0 so x= + 4 x is positive 4
x *= x       #=> 16
x **= x      #=> 18446744073709551616. Raise to the power
x /= x       #=> 1
----

== gets

.irb session
[source,text]
----
>> s1 = gets
hey
=> "hey\n"
>> s2 = gets.chomp
hey
=> "hey"
>> s3 = gets(chomp: true)
hey
=> "hey"
>> [s1, s2, s3]
=> ["hey\n", "hey", "hey"]
----

We can use keyword arg `gets(chomp: true)`, which is a smidge better then `gets.chomp`, maybe...

== Why long name initialize

[quote, Fernando Basso, Ruby Discord Server]
____
Also, Ruby has a lot of nice shortened names like to_i and to_s.
Why then would they name initialize this long instead of simply ini or init?
I feel languages in general have some inconsistencies in the decisions taken (as a user of those languages).
I imagine whoever was designing and implementing those things had reasons for doing things the way they did.
Else, they slipped up here and there, similar to PHP hell of parameter order.

[quote, yes, Ruby Discord]

I think it's fairly consistent. The X in to_x is a letter representing a data type.
Does ruby shorten things when it's not data-type dependent?
Nothing I can remember of the top of my head, but I have terrible memory.

== collect vs map name

== Object hierarchy

[source,irb]
----
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> Enumerator.produce(Class, &:superclass).take_while(&:itself)
=> [Class, Module, Object, BasicObject]
