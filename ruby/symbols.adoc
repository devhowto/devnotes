= Symbols :: Ruby
:icons: font

== Intro

Symbols make nice Hash keys.
They are preferred over strings for hash keys whenever possible.

One may think of a Symbol as a kind of name tag.
It's a label, not about the content.
A String is generally about the content.
In other languages one might see Symbols referred to as Atoms, or interned strings.
