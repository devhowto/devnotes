// This is not a singleton, and many different containers can be created
// and they all isolated from one another (unlike with a global,
// singleton state). Containers are more reusable.
//

//
// NOTE: although addBase in a container is not a mathematically pure
// function, you can get the same result by calling addBase if base is
// not changed (this characteristic is sometimes called idempotent).
