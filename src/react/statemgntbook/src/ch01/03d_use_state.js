//
// If the user clicks twice fast enough, it will increment by just one
// number. In this example, it the {count} would show a value like 3
// but “Set count to {count + 1}” would cause that {count + 1} to be 4.
//
// That is because the current new value of count is displayed on the
// next render. Imagine count is 1, {count + 1} will show as 2, but
// {count} on the <pre> tag is still showing the count 1 from the
// previous render.
//
// To avoid such situation, make sure to use a callback function of the
// form setCount(c => c + 1) like in many of the previous examples.
