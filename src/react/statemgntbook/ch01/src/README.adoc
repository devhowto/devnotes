= Basic State Hooks

== Bail out

Bail out is the term to describe a situation where a new state is the same as the previous state and therefore react is smart enough to _not_ re-render the component.

It happens when setting the same primitive value or the same reference object.

== useState

We can update the state with a value:

[source,javascript]
----
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

setCount(1);
setCount(count + 1);
----

Or

[source,javascript]
----
const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0 });

setState({ count: 2 });
----

But this wouldn't work, as the reference is still the same.
It won't rerender.

[source,javascript]
----
state.count += 1;
setState(state);
----

Update state with a function:

[source,javascript]
----
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

setCount(c => c + 1);
----

Or

[source,javascript]
----
const [count, setCount] = useState({ count: 1 });

setCount(prev => { ...prev, count: prev.count + 1 });
----
