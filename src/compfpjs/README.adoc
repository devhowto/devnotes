My notes and code from the the amazing link:https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript[Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript^] FREE course on Egghead by Brian Londsdorf!

== CommonJS

Because the course was created when ES Modules were not a thing (or at least not well supported supported), and it uses the an https://github.com/DrBoolean/immutable-ext[immutable.js extension (immutable-ext)] that was not (as of 2023) updated to also support ES modules, we'll stick to commonjs module system.
It won't make any difference for the concepts and ideas and we are just fine with this.
