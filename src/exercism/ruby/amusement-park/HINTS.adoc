== 1. Make new attendees

* Using the references, complete the initialize method to save the height to the object's state.

== 2. How tall is the attendee

* Create a getter for the saved height state.

== 3. What is the ride pass id

* Create a getter for the pass id.
* It is okay and expected to return `nil` before a pass is issued to the `Attendee`.

== 4. Allow people to buy a pass

* In the `Attendee#issue_pass!` method, set the instance's state to the argument.

== 5. Revoke the pass

* In the `Attendee#revoke_pass!` setter method set the instance's state so that no pass exists.
