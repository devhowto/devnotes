= Hints

== 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

* You need to define a https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/07/ruby-constants/[constant] that should contain the https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Integer.html[integer] value specified in the recipe.
* The `::` used in `Lasagna::EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` means that `EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` needs to be defined within the `Lasagna` class.

== 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

* You need to define a https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods[method] with a single parameter for the actual time so far.
* You can https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/idiomatic-ruby-writing-beautiful-code-6845c830c664/#implicit-return[implicitly return an integer] from the method.
* You can use the https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-arithmetic-operators.php[mathematical operator for subtraction] to subtract values.

== 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

* You need to define a https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods[method] with a single parameter for the number of layers.
* You can https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/idiomatic-ruby-writing-beautiful-code-6845c830c664/#implicit-return[implicitly return an integer] from the method.
* You can use the https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-arithmetic-operators.php[mathematical operator for multiplication] to multiply values.
* You could define an extra constant for the time in minutes per layer, or use a "magic number" in the code.

== 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

* You need to define a https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods[method] with two named parameters: `number_of_layers` and `actual_minutes_in_oven`.
* You can https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/idiomatic-ruby-writing-beautiful-code-6845c830c664/#implicit-return[implicitly return an integer] from the method.
* You can http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/objects/calling.html[invoke] one of the other methods you've defined previously.
* You can use the https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-arithmetic-operators.php[mathematical operator for addition] to add values.
