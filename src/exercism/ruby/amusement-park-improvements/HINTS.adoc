== 1. Check if an attendee has a ride pass

* Convert the pass_id to a boolean object.
* Look at the https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/BasicObject.html[`BasicObject`] class, it contains methods which most classes inherit.

== 2. Check if an attendee fits a ride

* Compare the ride's minimum height to the attendee's height.
* Look at the https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Comparable.html[`Comparable`] module, it contains methods for comparing objects which can be used when they are included.
 ** The https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Integer.html[Integer] class includes the https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Comparable.html[`Comparable`] module.

== 3. Check if an attendee is allowed to ride

* Combine the instance methods you've created using a https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_expressions.html#UG[boolean operator] to return the result.
