= Hints

== 1. Create the ports identifier

* You need to define a https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/07/ruby-constants/[constant] that should contain the symbol value specified in the instructions.

== 2. Get identifiers for other ports

* A string can be https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#class-String-label-String+Slices[slice] to get parts of it.
* `Strings` have a https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-upcase[method] to upcase the letters.
* `Strings` have a https://rubyapi.org/string#method-i-to_sym[method] to convert a string to a symbol.

== 3. Determine which terminal a ship should dock at

* Symbol has a https://rubyapi.org/symbol#method-i-to_s[method] to convert a symbol to a string.
* A string can be https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#class-String-label-String+Slices[slice] to get parts of it.
* Use conditional https://ruby-doc.org/core/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-if+Expression[`if`], to check if the ship is carrying `"OIL"` or `"GAS"`.
