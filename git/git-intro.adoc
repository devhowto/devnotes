== Read this first

[CAUTION]
====
Some git commands can potentially cause one to lose work.
Be careful with `reset`, `checkout` and possible a few others.

If in doubt (maybe even if not in doubt), commit your changes first and take note of the commit  hash (or use `reflog` later if necessary), then undo the commit and try whatever you are trying to do.
If things go awry, you have means to recover that temporary, _work in progress_ commit.

NOTE: I'll add more practical advice and examples here when time permits.
