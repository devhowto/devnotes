= Git :: Undoing Stuff
:toc: right
:icons: font
:stem: latexmath

[CAUTION]
====
Carefully read and impress upon yourself the importance of what is mentioned at the first admonition of link:./git-intro.adoc[git intro].

Very ominous, yes, but please follow the advice given there.
Better a little caution than a great regret.
You have been warned.
====

== Discard changes in unstaged files

[NOTE]
====
My git setup disables some hints to make commands like `git status` less verbose, for example:

----
$ git config --local advice.statusHints false
----
====

[WARNING]
====
The commands below will cause you to irreversibly and irrevocably lose your changes.
Read carefully before proceeding!
====

We have this changed file in our repo:

----
$ git status .
Untracked files:
	Makefile
----

We want to undo the changes â€” make it so as we never changed the file in the first place.
We can do:

----
$ git restore -- ./Makefile
----

In older version where `restore` is not available we can use `checkout`:

----
$ git checkout -- ./Makefile
----

== Unstage files

[NOTE]
====
This will remove the files from stage (a.k.a. the index), but your changes will still be present in the files.
====

If the file is staged:

----
$ git status .
Changes to be committed:
	modified:   Makefile
----

Then run:

----
$ git restore --staged -- ./Makefile
----

Or, if `restore` is not available on your version of git:

----
$ git reset -- ./Makefile
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	Makefile
----

Running `git status` should show `Makefile` as untracked, but still retaining all the changes:

----
$ git status .
Changes to be committed:
	modified:   Makefile
----

[TIP]
====
`git reset` *does not* discard changes to files.

* Running `git reset` on a staged file will unstage it.
* Running `git reset` on a non-staged file will simply do nothing.
  The contents of the file will remain intact.
